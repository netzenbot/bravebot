# Development and packaging

Start with [setup](setup.md). Run the `npm` commands from `ui/`; this is not an npm
workspace of the package at the repository root, so nothing there reaches these scripts.
Run the `cargo` commands from the root, where the workspace the two front-end crates are
members of lives.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm ci` | Install locked npm dependencies and set up Electron |
| `npm run dev` | Set up Electron, build both Rust executables, start hot reload |
| `npm run bridge` | Build `bravebot-rpc` and `bravebot-ui-files`, loading credentials where configured |
| `npm run setup:electron` | Install the Electron runtime if needed and name the development app |
| `npm run name-dev-app` | Restore “Brave Bot” as the development app's menu-bar name |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run build` | Build both Rust executables, typecheck, bundle into `out/` |
| `npm start` | Set up Electron and preview the existing bundle; does not rebuild it |
| `npm run package` | Build both Rust executables, bundle, package for macOS or Linux; does not typecheck |
| `cargo test -p bravebot-ui-bridge -p bravebot-ui-files` | Test the two front-end crates |
| `cargo test --all` | Test the whole workspace, agent crates included |
| `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` | Lint the whole workspace |
| `npm run drive` / `npm run drive:<name>` | Run a named Electron driver; see [testing](testing.md) |
| `npm run demo -- --record` | Record a walkthrough; see [demo costs and setup](demo.md) |

TypeScript uses strict checking, including `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`,
`noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters`. There is no ESLint or Prettier gate.
See [testing](testing.md#what-ci-runs) for exactly what CI checks and what must run locally.

## Build and preview

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

With a desktop display available, `npm run drive:smoke` checks that the window and
main UI are visible and the Rust bridge responds, then saves a screenshot under
`/tmp/bravebot-ui/`. To check a Linux package, run
`npm run drive:smoke -- "./dist/Brave Bot-linux-x64/Brave Bot"`.

`scripts/build-bridge.sh` builds the Rust bridge and secure-file helper. TypeScript
then checks the code and electron-vite bundles the main process, preload and React
renderer into `out/`. Development executables are in the workspace `../target/debug/`.

The bridge talks to the pinned agent library over a child-process protocol; it does
not drive a terminal. See the [protocol design](phase-0-rpc-protocol.md) and
[security boundaries](security.md).

## Packaging

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run package
```

`npm run package` does not typecheck. It builds the Rust executables and Electron
bundles, then `scripts/package.mjs` uses `@electron/packager` to create
`dist/Brave Bot-darwin-<arch>/Brave Bot.app` on macOS or
`dist/Brave Bot-linux-<arch>/` on Linux. Launch the Linux package with
`"./dist/Brave Bot-linux-x64/Brave Bot"` (replace `x64` for other architectures).
The platform and architecture follow the Node process. Rust uses its configured toolchain target; for a native
bundle, use matching Node and Rust architectures.

Both `bravebot-rpc` and `bravebot-ui-files` are copied into the app's Resources.
Packaged builds use those copies; development builds use the workspace `../target/debug/`.
The script currently packages debug Rust executables, and performs no app signing
or notarisation. The resulting bundle is for local testing, not a completed
release-distribution pipeline. Git commit signatures are separate from macOS app signing.

A development checkout can produce a configured or unconfigured binary depending
on the build environment. Follow [credentials](setup.md#credentials) before packaging
for inference; Finder does not load shell configuration. Packaging itself does not
check that backend credentials exist.

To check the bundle, use the [packaged-app drivers](testing.md#current-regression-checks).
AppKit takes the menu-bar name from the bundle's `CFBundleName`; changing
`app.name` would also change Electron's user-data location.
