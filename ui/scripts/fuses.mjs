// Electron's fuses: switches compiled into the Electron binary, read before any of our code runs.
//
// A release has to turn some of them off, because the app is signed as Brave and every one of
// these makes the signed binary run code that is not ours. With `RunAsNode` on,
// `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` turns the app into a Node interpreter for whatever script it is handed;
// `NODE_OPTIONS` and `--inspect` get code into the main process by other routes. Integrity
// validation and loading only from the asar close the last one, a changed `app.asar` or an `app/`
// directory beside it.
//
// Setting them is a byte write, so it is done here rather than by adding `@electron/fuses`: the
// format is a sentinel, a version byte, a count byte, then one byte per fuse, `0` or `1`, or `r`
// for one Electron has removed. The write changes the binary, so it happens before signing.
