# contrib

Tools that are useful for working on bravebot but are not part of it. Nothing here is built or
shipped, and nothing in `crates/` depends on any of it. One is run by CI: `measure-flakes.py`, on a
weekly schedule, since what it measures takes many runs of an unchanged tree.

## check-toolchain.py

Answers whether clippy on this machine knows the lints CI will fail on.

CI installs whatever stable is on the day it runs, and clippy gains lints with every release, so a
host a few releases behind passes a lint CI fails. Nothing in a diff shows this, and the first
report of it is a red build on code that was checked before it was pushed.

Rust ships every six weeks and rustc states its own release date, so the gap is measurable without
asking the network what stable is today. Anything under a release old passes silently.

```sh
make check-toolchain          # or contrib/check-toolchain.py
```

`make check` runs it last and fails on it, since that target's claim is that passing it means CI
passes. It compiles nothing. `--warn` prints the same thing and exits zero, and
`BRAVEBOT_ALLOW_STALE_TOOLCHAIN=1` skips it, for a host that cannot have the newer toolchain.

`make check-linux` is the way to run CI's fmt, clippy and tests on current stable regardless of
what the host has.

## measure-flakes.py

Names every test that does not agree with itself, and how often.

[checks.md](../docs/development/checks.md) says a failure that does not reproduce is a flake and to
carry on rather than chase it, which is sound only if somebody knows which tests actually do that.
Nothing measured it, so the answer was a shrug. Some tests here stand up a real server on an
ephemeral port, and some spawn a program they have just written, and those are the ones that lose a
run.

One build, that build run N times, and a table of the tests whose outcome changed, worst rate first,
each with the panic it produced so that one cause across five tests reads as one thing.

```sh
contrib/measure-flakes.py --runs 30
contrib/measure-flakes.py --runs 30 --test-threads 4   # what make check-linux caps the suite to
```

Nothing fails over a rate. A job that goes red for a known two percent flake is a job people learn
to ignore, which is the problem this exists for, so a rate is reported and never gated on.

`--file-issues OWNER/REPO` opens one issue per flaky test, titled `Flaky test: <name>`, saying the
rate, the parallelism it was measured at and what the failure said. A test that already has an issue
under that title gets nothing, whoever opened it, so a weekly run adds only what is new instead of
filing the same test every Monday. `--dry-run` prints what it would send and sends nothing;
`--issue-limit` bounds how many one run may open, since the first measurement of a suite nobody has
measured could otherwise arrive as twenty issues at once. The exit code is still not a verdict on
the tests: it is nonzero when the measurement did not happen, or when an issue that was meant to be
filed was not, because a filer that has quietly stopped working looks exactly like a suite that
stopped being flaky.

`--summary FILE` appends the same report to a file, which is how the weekly
[Test determinism](../.github/workflows/test-determinism.yml) workflow puts it in a job summary.
That workflow names both thread counts rather than leaving either to cargo, since a hosted runner
has four cores and cargo's default there is already the cap: four threads and sixteen. Sixteen on a
four core runner is those cores oversubscribed rather than a stand-in for a sixteen core machine, so
what the legs differ by is the cost of oversubscription. Only the wider leg files issues, since both
legs measure the same tests and both filing would race to open two issues for one flake.

Every report says how many CPUs the machine had and which failure rate that many runs could actually
have seen, because neither is recoverable afterwards and both decide what the numbers mean. A sweep
shorter than a flake's rate needs will not see it, and a quiet runner will not reproduce a race that
wants a machine with something else on it, so a report naming nothing bounds the flakiness rather
than ruling it out.

`--selftest` checks the parsing against output whose answer is known and runs no tests. It is a job
of its own in that workflow, which is also what a pull request touching this file runs, and the
thing to run after touching a regular expression here: a parser that matches nothing reports a clean
suite forever.

## drive_tui.py

Drives the terminal interface from a script, so the parts of it that a unit test cannot reach can
be exercised anyway.

Most of the interface is wiring: a key press becomes an `Action`, the action calls into the agent,
and what comes back is drawn. The tests under `crates/tui` cover each of those pieces on its own,
and every interface bug found so far has been in the joins between them rather than in the pieces.
`/compact` shipped once with no capability to reach the model and was refused every time it was
used; the context gauge read nothing at all for a while; a summary came back and the planner
disbelieved it. None of those is visible from `cargo test`, and all three are obvious within one
scripted session.

### Running one

A script is one step per line: how long to wait, then the keys to send.

```
# Answer the trust prompt, hold four short exchanges, then summarise them.
10   y
90   say one\r
90   say two\r
90   say three\r
90   say four\r
90   /compact\r
90   what did I ask you first\r
10   /exit\r
```

```sh
cargo build
cd /tmp/scratch
contrib/drive_tui.py session.txt --squash -- target/debug/bravebot
```

The command to run goes after `--`. `-` in place of the script file reads the script from stdin.

A step's number is a timeout rather than a sleep. While a turn runs the spinner animates several
times a second, so the stream is never quiet, and the step ends as soon as it goes still. Give
each step longer than the slowest reply you expect and the script will still run at the speed of
the model.

### Asserting against the output

Pass `--squash`, and search for text with the spaces taken out:

```sh
contrib/drive_tui.py session.txt --squash -- target/debug/bravebot | grep -o 'summarised[0-9]*earlier'
```

This is not a terminal emulator. Escape sequences are stripped rather than interpreted, so the
characters come out in the right order and the wrong shape: a sentence the interface wrapped
across two lines arrives with a box border through the middle of it. `--squash` removes the
whitespace and the box drawing so a substring check can be trusted. `--raw FILE` keeps the
untouched capture if you want to look at what really happened.

### What it needs

A backend, like any other session. Either the configured one, or a local
[aichat](https://github.com/brave/aichat) with `BRAVE_AI_CHAT_ENDPOINT` pointed at it:

```sh
BRAVE_AI_CHAT_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8000 contrib/drive_tui.py session.txt -- target/debug/bravebot
```

`BRAVEBOT_CONTEXT_BUDGET` is worth setting low when the thing being tested is compaction, since the
default is a hundred thousand tokens and a scripted session will not reach it.

Sessions it runs are real: they are written to `~/.bravebot/sessions` like any other, and a script that
approves a write will write the file. Run it somewhere disposable.
