"""Link the checked-in agent configuration into each tool's discovery directory.

The source of truth is `agents/`: versioned, reviewed, and named for no particular
vendor. No tool reads it. Claude Code discovers skills, slash commands and subagents
under `.claude/`; Codex discovers skills under `.agents/skills`; Cursor discovers skills
and subagents under `.cursor/`; and bravebot discovers skills under `.bravebot/skills`.
Codex, Cursor and bravebot read their instructions from `AGENTS.md` at the workspace
root. This script bridges them by creating one symlink per entry, so a skill is written
once and every tool sees it:

    .claude/skills/<name>    ->  agents/skills/<name>
    .agents/skills/<name>    ->  agents/skills/<name>
    .bravebot/skills/<name>  ->  agents/skills/<name>
    .cursor/skills/<name>    ->  agents/skills/<name>
    .claude/CLAUDE.md        ->  agents/AGENTS.md
    AGENTS.md                ->  agents/AGENTS.md
    .claude/settings.json    ->  agents/settings.json
    .bravebot/settings.json  ->  agents/settings.json

The generated links are gitignored and never committed, which is why this runs from
`make init` rather than being a one-time setup somebody has to remember.

It is idempotent: re-running only creates links that are missing or stale, and it never
clobbers a real file or directory somebody placed in a discovery dir by hand.

It does not touch the trust map. bravebot loads a workspace skill only from a path a
person vouched for (TRUST-1 in docs/specs/trust-map.md), and a script granting that on
the user's behalf is exactly the inference that clause forbids. Expect to be asked once,
at startup, about `.bravebot/skills`.

On Windows we COPY instead of symlink, because git's symlink support there is unreliable
and creating symlinks often needs elevated privileges.

Usage:
    python3 agents/setup.py link    # create the links (default)
    python3 agents/setup.py list    # show source vs. linked state
    python3 agents/setup.py unlink  # remove only the links we own

# bravebot and Codex read skills only. Cursor also reads subagents, but it dropped slash
# commands in favour of skills, so `commands/` links into `.claude/` alone.
#
