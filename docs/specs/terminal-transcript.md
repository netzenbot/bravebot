## Scope

What is drawn back to the user: the transcript, a resumed session, how content is shaped on its
way to the screen, which palette paints the interface, and what the environment can decline of
both. Presentation holds no labels, and the
rules here are about a person being able to see what the agent did. What the user types into is
[terminal-input.md](terminal-input.md). A line beginning with `/` is [commands.md](commands.md).

## Clauses

### VIEW-1: the end of a reply is visible when it arrives, and scrolling back is deliberate

A wrapped reply shows its end as it lands. Scrolling back changes the view and holds it there.

### VIEW-2: a resumed session shows what the earlier turns did

The trail, the plan worked to, the calls made, and what has been spent all come back, so reading a
transcript back does not depend on remembering the session. Each recorded turn keeps its prompt and
outcome, including failures and cancellation after visible work. A task list keeps its recorded
unfinished items and stays on its own turn; a following turn with no list does not inherit it.

### VIEW-3: untrusted content is shown on purpose, inside a margin it cannot forge

Showing it is deliberate and not a leak. Filenames out of a quarantined listing, the first lines of
a file nobody vouched for, what a processor produced, the body of every write: all of it reaches
the person watching, because an agent that will not say which file it is working on has protected
nobody. It is the planner that may not read untrusted content, and a terminal is not a planner's
context. It reaches a screen under a witness minted for release to a display and for nothing else.

What must hold is how it is drawn. A bar runs down the margin of every **drawn row** of the block,
and the content never gets to draw its own, so a file containing "untrusted content ends here" ends
nothing. A caption can be imitated by the thing it captions; a margin cannot. Never replace the bar
with a heading, and never show untrusted content outside a marked block.

Rows rather than lines, because a line longer than the terminal is wide becomes several of them. It
is broken to the width by the same step that draws the margin, and each row it breaks into carries
a bar of its own. Leaving the break to the paragraph the block is drawn in is the same defect as
omitting the margin: the continuation starts at column 0, which is untrusted content outside the
block, positioned wherever the content's own padding chose to put it. Nothing is dropped to make a
line fit. The block's heading is laid out the same way and for the same reason, since the origin
named in it can be a filename read out of a quarantined listing.

Every control character is replaced with a visible glyph on the way to the screen, in the heading
as well as the content. Replaced rather than dropped, since a character silently removed is one the
user cannot tell was ever in the file.

### VIEW-4: untrusted content is never drawn as structure

A quarantined preview is never drawn as a table. Everything untrusted goes through the margin and
control-character replacement of VIEW-3. Shell mode output is **not** drawn as quarantined,
because it is trusted, and it still cannot draw its own escapes.

### VIEW-5: a tiny terminal still renders

question out of view.

### VIEW-6: a reply is drawn as it arrives, and the round that ends replaces it

The words are drawn where the finished entry will be and in the shape it will have, so nothing on
the screen moves when the round ends. A round that finishes with nothing to say takes its own tail
down, and so does a turn that fails, is stopped, or has to send its request again: what an
abandoned attempt had written is no part of the reply that replaces it.

**Why.** The longest silence in a turn is the one while the model writes, and it is the silence
with the most to show. A counter reports that something is happening; it does not report what.

The words are untrusted model output released for a screen, on the same footing as everything else
in this file and through the same gate. Released once for the round rather than once per frame,
because it is one release however many pieces it arrives in.

### VIEW-7: where a result went is drawn only where that is not the ordinary answer

A call whose result the planner may read says nothing about it. A result the planner may not read
says so, and so does a name that was never opened.

**Why.** Nearly every call reads into the planner's context, and a line under nearly every call
distinguishes nothing while crowding out the lines that do. What the design turns on is the
exception, and the exception is still marked twice over: on the call, and again in the margin of
the block its content is drawn in.

Recording is unaffected. What is dropped here is a row on a screen, not a fact: where every result
went is still in the audit trail, which is what the record is for.

<a id="VIEW-8"></a>
### VIEW-8: a note from the session is drawn in one ink of its own

What the session says in its own voice, the trust answer, an unavailable confinement, a status
report, is drawn in a single ink belonging to nothing else, and never in the ink that marks
untrusted content.

**Why.** That ink is spoken for twice over: a call still running, and the margin down every block
of content the planner may not read. Drawing a note in it said the trust answer was quarantined.
An ink of its own rather than merely a different one, because a note sharing with any third meaning
puts the question back where it started.

This is about which ink, and it is never what makes the marking hold. VIEW-3 stands on the margin
because a colour can be imitated by the content beside it, and nothing here weakens that: no ink
tells a reader whether something is quarantined, and a note drawn in the wrong one would still be
outside a block.

<a id="VIEW-9"></a>
### VIEW-9: under `brave`, an ink that carries meaning is mixed, not chosen by the terminal

Where a colour is what tells one thing on the screen from another, and the theme in force is
`brave`, it is a shade this interface mixes. The sixteen named colours are slots a terminal
repaints, so they are used only where the meaning is the terminal's own and the slot is one
schemes agree about: green for finished, red for failed, yellow for a call still running, which
are read against whatever palette the user chose rather than against each other. An aside is not
one of those and is mixed, and neither is the ink that tells shell mode from ordinary mode and a
directory from a file. A mixed shade that has to stay legible against the background is picked
for the background sensed at startup, and a terminal that will not say gets the shade for a dark
one.

**Why.** A named slot is a request, not a colour. The same code drew a different colour in every
profile, which is how one slot came to carry two meanings at once without anybody choosing that.
Bright black, the slot an aside would take, is where that disagreement is worst: across the 606
schemes in the iTerm2 collection it falls below 4.5:1 against its own background in 88% of the
dark ones and reaches 1.8:1 at the bottom, so an aside was legible or not according to a choice
nobody here made. Mixing it holds the contrast steady, and the shade still recedes behind the
scheme's own foreground in roughly nine schemes out of ten.

### VIEW-10: a palette a person chose paints every role from that table

A theme chosen with `/theme` mixes every semantic ink from the palette that name names, including
the background and the default text. Named ANSI slots are not used there, so two roles cannot
collapse because the terminal remapped green. The choice is a keystroke on this surface, the same
endorsement `/model` takes for a request field. Moving the cursor live-previews: the theme under
the cursor is put in force for as long as it is selected, and Escape restores the theme that was
in force when the picker opened.

**Why.** Leaving finished and failed as named slots under a named theme would put the person's
chosen palette and the terminal's remapping in a fight over the same meaning. Previewing on the
cursor rather than only on Enter is what lets a person compare themes against their own transcript
before committing.

### VIEW-11: user theme files are read only from `~/.bravebot/themes`

A JSON file whose stem is the theme name is loaded from the user's own themes directory and from
nowhere else. A workspace `.bravebot/themes` is not consulted: that directory is workspace content,
and a palette file must not become a decision taken from untrusted bytes. An unknown or unreadable
stored name is `brave`. A broken file is omitted from the list rather than crashing. The earlier
name `system` still finds `brave`, so a choice saved under that name is not silently lost, and a
user file may not take either name: it would load and then be unreachable.

<a id="VIEW-12"></a>
### VIEW-12: the theme picker is a centred panel over the session

`/theme` draws a bordered panel in the middle of the screen. The session stays visible behind it,
and is redrawn each time the cursor moves so the live preview is of the person's own transcript
rather than of an empty page. The panel is sized to the list and stays inside the frame on a tiny
terminal. It is not a full-screen takeover.

Under the list is a row for what the theme on the cursor does that its name does not say. A theme
whose inks were picked for the background sensed at startup has that row filled, which is `brave`,
every family published in both polarities, and any user theme that gave a pair. The row is drawn
empty rather than dropped for the themes with nothing to add, so the list does not shift under the
cursor as it moves.

**Why.** A full-screen list hides the thing a theme is for. The same centred-panel shape the write
and trust prompts already use keeps the person oriented, and putting the session behind the panel
is what makes previewing honest. A name is where a person looks first for what a theme will do, and
no name on this list says whether its inks were chosen for the terminal: `brave` names who it is
from, and `gruvbox` names a scheme without saying it has two halves. That is the one property the
list cannot carry, which is why it is the one the row does.

### VIEW-13: the end of a turn is said, not left to the indicator disappearing

A finished turn is reported on its own row: which turn it was, what it cost, and how long it took.
A turn that failed and a turn that was cancelled get the same row without the cost and the duration.
VIEW-22 covers what each of the three endings is called, and the reason a failed one carries. The
row lasts until the next turn starts, and a session that has not run one shows nothing.

**Why.** The indicator going out was the only thing that said a turn was over, and an announcement
made by something disappearing is one nobody reads. It matters most for the turn that ends on a
sentence like `now let me look at the dispatch code`: the model asked for no tool, so the turn ended
there, and the last thing on the screen was a promise with nothing to distinguish it from a hang.
The cost is on the row because a turn that spent forty rounds and one that spent a single round look
identical in scrollback, and the difference is most of the explanation. Both figures are off the
other two endings because they price an answer, and a turn abandoned part way produced none. What
it did spend is counted against the session all the same.

### VIEW-14: the model picker narrows as it is typed into

`/model` draws a bordered panel in the middle of the screen, over the session it was opened from,
with a search box above the list. Typing narrows the list rather than walking it, matching without
regard to case anywhere in the name shown, in the name a request would carry, and in the service
that answers; every word typed has to match something. The cursor stays on the model it was on
where that model still matches, and falls to the first match where it does not. A search matching
nothing says so, and there is nothing to select while it does.

**Why.** A gateway's roster runs to hundreds of models, and the picker offers it alongside Brave's
own and whatever a settings file configured. No arrangement of a list that long makes arrowing to
one row reasonable, and a name is remembered by a word out of the middle of it, or by the service
it is reached through, rather than by how it starts. A cursor that stayed at its index would land
on an unrelated model with every keystroke, which is worst exactly where the list is long enough to
need searching.

### VIEW-15: every model is drawn under the service that will answer it

The picker groups its rows by service, one heading per service, in the order the roster first
mentions each one. The models Brave's own endpoint serves are named as a service like any other.
A service that the roster mentions in more than one place is still one section. Where a section is
scrolled through, its heading is held on the top line of the list, so no row on screen is without
the name of what answers it. Only a list of a single row is exempt, having nowhere to put both: it
keeps the row under the cursor.

**Why.** The same name is reachable through more than one service, billed and credentialled
differently, and which of them answers is the whole of what is being chosen between. Said once over
a section rather than on every row, because the alternative repeats a gateway's name down hundreds
of rows and pushes the part that identifies the model off the panel. Holding the heading while the
section scrolls is what keeps that true of a roster too long to see at once, which is the only kind
a gateway has.

### VIEW-16: a user theme may give one colour for each terminal background

An ink in a theme file is either one value or a pair, `{"dark": …, "light": …}`, and a pair
resolves to the arm matching the background sensed at startup. Neither arm is a special kind of
value, so a pair composes with `defs` and with `none` exactly as a lone value does. A pair missing
an arm is not an ink, and the file holding it is not a theme. A file that gives at least one pair
is marked as depending on the terminal, which is what the row under the picker's list is read from.

**Why.** A scheme published for a light terminal and a dark one is one theme a person names, not
two, and shipping it as two files leaves them to work out which their terminal wants. Refusing a
half-written pair rather than filling in the missing arm keeps a typo from painting half a palette,
where the wrong half is the one its author never sees.

<a id="VIEW-17"></a>
### VIEW-17: a scheme published in both polarities is one row, and each half stays reachable

Where a built-in scheme was published for a light terminal and a dark one, the picker lists a
single row under the family's name, painted from the half matching the background sensed at
startup. Both fixed halves keep the names they had and still resolve through `/theme`, each with
the palette its name says, whichever background was sensed. A half is not listed, with one
exception: the half already in force is, since a picker that cannot show the current theme has no
row to open on. A scheme published in one polarity only, and a second dark scheme from the same
authors, are each their own row as before.

**Why.** Two rows for one scheme make a person work out which of them their terminal wants, and
answer it again on the next machine. Sensing the background answers it for them, but sensing is a
guess wherever a terminal will not say, and a guess that cannot be overruled is worse than the two
rows were. Keeping the halves resolvable is what makes the adapting row safe to prefer: being
guessed wrong about costs one `/theme` and it stays fixed.

### VIEW-18: a model's own working is not drawn as its answer

Where a reply opens with a reasoning block and closes it before answering, the block is not
drawn, arriving or arrived, and what reaches the transcript is what follows it. Only a block the
reply opens with counts: a reply that mentions the tags further down keeps every word. A block
opened and never closed is drawn whole once the reply is finished, and drawn as nothing while it
is still being written, as is a part-written opening.

**Why.** A model with a channel of its own for its working keeps it out of the reply, and this
never arises. A model without one writes the same words into the reply instead, where they land
on top of the answer: a paragraph nobody asked for above every answer, kept in the session record
and drawn again on every resume.

What an unclosed block means is the whole of the difference between the two cases. Part way
through a reply it means the model is still thinking, and drawing a thought only to take it back
when the close arrives is a flicker on every turn such a model takes. At the end of a reply it
means the words ran out mid-thought, and a truncated thought on the screen says more than a blank
where the answer should be.

Taking it off is a decision read out of the reply, so it belongs to the side that draws rather
than to the turn. The driver hands over every byte without looking at it, because in a session
that has observed untrusted content those are untrusted bytes and it may not branch on them.

### VIEW-19: a note is the session speaking, not a detail of the line above it

A note is drawn at the column the rest of the transcript's text starts in, without the marker that
ties a line to the entry above it. Consecutive notes are drawn as one block, and the blank line
falls after the last of them rather than between each.

**Why.** The marker means the line belongs to the entry above it, and a note belongs to no entry:
the ones startup leaves are drawn before there is anything above them at all, so the marker pointed
at nothing and left the note hanging off it.

The spacing is the same fact from the other side. A session reporting three things as it starts is
making one report, and a blank between each presents it as three separate turns. The run ends where
the notes do, so the last of them is still held apart from whatever is said next.

### VIEW-20: `NO_COLOR` is honoured, and outranks the theme in force

Where `NO_COLOR` is set to anything but the empty string, every role is drawn in the terminal's own
ink and this program adds none of its own: the background it would paint, the shades it mixes, the
named slots it asks for, and the gradient across the wordmark. The terminal is not asked about its
background either, since nothing is drawn in a shade picked for one. A theme somebody chose stays
recorded and paints again once the variable is unset.

Distinctions this interface makes in colour alone are lost, which is what was asked for. Nothing a
colour was not carrying is lost with them: the margin down a block of content the planner may not
read is a glyph on every row, and it is drawn the same way. The one distinction that is kept is the
row a cursor is on, which is drawn in reverse video instead of a fill: a list nobody can see their
place in cannot be walked, and reverse video asks the terminal to swap the two inks the person
already chose rather than naming one.

**Why.** The convention costs a person one variable rather than one setting per program, which is
the whole of its value: somebody whose terminal renders colour badly, or who cannot read a shade
this interface picked, says so once. Reading the presence of the variable rather than its value is
the convention as written, and `NO_COLOR=0` is somebody who set it: a value that switched colour
back on would need every program reading one to agree on which words mean false.

It outranks a chosen theme because the two answer different questions. A theme says which palette
to draw in, and the variable says whether to draw in a palette at all, so there is no order in
which the theme wins that is not this program deciding it knows better. The choice is kept rather
than cleared, which is what makes the variable a switch rather than an edit.

### VIEW-21: `NO_MOTION` stills the glyph, and the counters go on counting

Where `NO_MOTION` is set to anything but the empty string, the glyph beside a running turn stands
still instead of cycling. It is still drawn, and the elapsed time and the token counts change as
they always did: a figure that moves when the thing it measures moves is information rather than
animation.

It is read from the environment the way the request for no colour is, and answers to presence the
same way. Where it is not set, the glyph cycles.

**Why.** Constant motion is tiring to work beside, and worse than tiring for vestibular
sensitivity, so it is something a person can decline. Stilling the glyph rather than dropping it
keeps the indicator answering the question it exists for: a turn runs with nothing else on the
screen moving, so a row with nothing in it would be indistinguishable from a program that had hung.

The variable is the environment rather than a settings file because the preference belongs to the
person and their terminal rather than to a project, and because it has to hold for the first frame,
which is drawn before any file this program reads has been looked for.

### VIEW-22: failed and cancelled turns have distinct visible status

A failed turn shows a reason below its status and in its transcript entry. The reason uses fixed
text and the backend's known status and request count. It remains visible with the audit expanded
or collapsed, after resizing, and while reading older scrollback. Long reasons wrap within the
available space. Terminal control characters are not drawn.

Failure, cancellation, and success have distinct labels. A successful turn after a failure shows
its own status. Failure labels use the failure colour; shared details keep their muted colour.
Ending a turn preserves the visible scrollback position, including when the status changes height.
The live session's export includes its failure and cancellation entries.
