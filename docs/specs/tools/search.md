## Scope

Finding lines in the workspace that match a pattern. `pattern`, `directory`, `include`, `offset`,
`case_sensitive`, `context` and `output` are routing: the first three name where to look and what to look for,
the offset names which page of the matches to return, the flag decides which of the lines there
match, and the context is a count of how many neighbouring lines to show with each, and the output names whether
to return the lines, only the files they are in, or a count ([SEARCH-12](#SEARCH-12)). `directory` may
name one file instead of a directory ([SEARCH-11](#SEARCH-11)).
The only content argument is the `why` every tool takes ([TOOL-5](tool-surface.md#TOOL-5)). The result is
the matching lines, the files or counts, or a reference.

## Clauses

<a id="SEARCH-1"></a>
### SEARCH-1: the pattern is a regular expression, matched without backtracking

Supported: literals, `.`, `*`, `+`, `?`, `|`, `(...)`, `(?:...)`, `[...]` with ranges and
negation, `\d`, `\w`, `\s` and their negations, `^`, `$`, `\b`, `\B`, the case flags `(?i)` and
`(?-i)` described in [SEARCH-6](#SEARCH-6), and a backslash before a metacharacter to match it
literally.

Counted repetition (`a{2,9}`) is absent and `{` is an ordinary character. Backreferences are
absent, and so are lookaround, named groups and every flag but `i`. Captures are not extracted: a
search reports the line, so whether the pattern matched is the whole question, and `(?:...)` is
therefore the same group as `(...)`.

`pattern` may be a list, and a line matching any of them matches. That is one more expression to
try per line, so the work is the sum of the patterns rather than a power of anything.

Case folding is done by the engine, never by lowercasing the pattern, which would rewrite `\D`,
`\W` and `\S` into the classes they negate and invert what the search asked for.

**Why.** A pattern arriving through a turn is attack surface, and the danger is catastrophic
backtracking rather than regular expressions as such: `(a+)+$` costs exponential time on a
backtracking engine and nothing unusual on one that does not backtrack. The engine simulates an
NFA, advancing a set of states one character at a time, so matching costs the length of the line
times the size of the pattern whatever the pattern is. Counted repetition is the one construct
that would break that bound, because nesting two multiplies the states a short pattern expands
to, and backreferences are not regular at all: matching one needs the backtracking this rules out.

Hand-written rather than a dependency, for the reason the conventions give.

Brace groups in `include` are **expanded before the walk**, not matched during it. Each alternative
is an ordinary pattern applied once per path, so a group costs a multiple of the work rather than a
power of it, and an expansion past the cap falls back to matching the pattern literally. A glob
with a `/` in it may be written from `directory` or from the workspace root, as
[LIST-3](list-files.md#LIST-3) reads a listing's.

### SEARCH-2: a result touching several files is trusted only if every one of them is

Otherwise it is quarantined whole. Unlike a listing, a search returns one reference for the whole
result rather than one per hit, so its hits are not addresses.

<a id="SEARCH-3"></a>
### SEARCH-3: a truncated search tells the planner it is incomplete

A complete one makes no such claim, so the planner can tell the difference between "nothing more"
and "nothing more shown".

Every cap counts: one that stopped at the limit on matches, one that stopped before it had opened
every file, and one that ran out of time are equally partial. The last two are the more dangerous,
because with nothing found there is nothing to look incomplete. The claim reaches the planner
whether or not it may read the result, since a notice written inside a body the planner is never
shown tells it nothing.

The file cap is set for a search rather than for a listing, and far above it. A listing's paths are
the answer and each one is spent on context; a search's paths are never shown, and only matching
lines are, which have a cap of their own. Holding a search to a listing's budget bought no context
back and cost whole subtrees.

Which files a capped search kept must not depend on the order the filesystem handed them over. A
walk sorts each directory and takes its own files before descending, so a partial answer is the
same partial answer on every machine and is the shallow part of the tree rather than a scattering
through it.

The time cap is the one cap this does not hold for. It stops the search at a moment, not at a
count, so a search it stops may have read more or fewer files on a slower or busier machine, and on
a second run of the same call. The planner is told the search is incomplete either way.

<a id="SEARCH-4"></a>
### SEARCH-4: a pattern that will not compile is reported as such, never as an empty result

The pattern is compiled before any file is opened, and a failure names what is wrong with it. A
`(?` opening a construct the engine lacks is named as that, not reported as the repeat with
nothing before it that its `?` would otherwise be.

**Why.** The two answers mean opposite things. Reported as nothing found, a syntax error reads as
proof the tree holds no match, and a planner that believes that stops looking: whole rounds went
on rephrasing patterns against a matcher that never ran them. This is the same reason a truncated
search says it is truncated, for the answer that looks most like a complete one.

Compiling first is also what keeps the report free of anything read: the pattern is routing the
planner proposed, so saying why it will not compile discloses nothing about the workspace.

<a id="SEARCH-5"></a>
### SEARCH-5: an empty result says whether anything was searched

A search whose `include` selected no files reports that, and says so instead of reporting no
matches. One that read files and found nothing reports no matches, as before.

A search left with nothing to read because a permission rule covers what it selected reports the
rule, and says that retrying is not the answer. The rule is stated, never which paths it reached:
the names are what it is keeping back. A rule that covers nothing the `include` selected is not the
reason, and the search reports the glob as it would with no rule in force. See
[permissions.md](../permissions.md).

**Why.** The two are opposite facts wearing the same sentence. Files were read and the pattern was
not in them, which is evidence about the tree. Or nothing was read at all, which is evidence about
the query and says nothing whatever about the tree. Rendered identically, a planner cannot tell
them apart, and the failure is not hypothetical: a real turn wrote `**/*.{cc,h,mm}` when brace
groups were unsupported, got "(no matches)", retreated to `**/*.cc`, and answered the question
wrong because the files it needed were the two extensions it had just dropped.

**Why the rule is a third answer.** A glob that selected nothing is a query to rewrite, and a rule
is not: no spelling reaches past one. Reported as the first, it sends the planner through rounds of
globs against a refusal none of them can satisfy, which is the same failure as the brace group and
costs more, because there is no spelling that ends it.

Where the glob also leans on syntax the matcher does not have, the result says which, for the same
reason [SEARCH-4](#SEARCH-4) reports a pattern that will not compile and against the same failure.
Advice is decided from the glob, which the planner proposed and the routing gate vouched for; the
result decides only whether there was anything to advise about.

<a id="SEARCH-6"></a>
### SEARCH-6: case sensitivity is asked for, never inferred

A search matches case exactly unless `case_sensitive` is false or the pattern says `(?i)`. The
flag is the same request written in the pattern: `(?i)` folds case from where it is written to the
end of the group it is in, `(?-i)` stops folding the same way, and `(?i:...)` and `(?-i:...)`
apply to only what they enclose. A search with `case_sensitive` false starts folded, so `(?-i)`
narrows it. Nothing else about the pattern widens it, whatever letters it holds, and a line is
reported as it is written rather than as it was folded to match.

**Why.** A search that quietly widened itself would report matches whose reason the caller cannot
see. The alternative to offering the flag is worse than either: a planner that cannot ask for it
mangles the pattern instead, and a real turn searched for `olicy` to get around a capital `P`. That
finds the word it wanted and every other word ending in those letters, with nothing in the result
to say so.

**Why the pattern may ask too.** `(?i)` is how almost every other engine spells the request, and a
planner writes it by habit. Refused, it cost a round each time it was written, and one real turn
did not retry and answered without the search. The flag is an explicit request, which is all this
clause asks of one; what it rules out is a search deciding for itself.

### SEARCH-7: vendored and generated directories are not walked

A fixed list of directory names is skipped: version control, build output, caches, and dependencies
fetched or vendored, and `.worktrees` and `.claude/worktrees`, where linked worktrees live: each is
a full copy of the tree, so walking it reports every match twice and can spend the match cap before
the walk reaches the tree the search is about. A search that names a directory inside it still
reads it; only a walk from above skips it. This is size hygiene applied to **names**, and nothing is read to decide it.

**Why.** A tree that mirrors its dependencies holds far more of them than of its own code, so a
walk that counts them reaches its cap without reaching the project. A real search for a common word
spent its entire budget inside a Rust crate mirror and reported documentation comments about the
wrong meaning of the word.

The project's own `.gitignore` would generalise better and is deliberately not used. It would
decide what to walk from the contents of a file in the tree being walked, and a tree that can hide
its own files from a search is a tree that can hide them from review. The names on the list are
ones no project uses for its own sources, so skipping them needs nobody's word for it.

<a id="SEARCH-8"></a>
### SEARCH-8: a search stopped by the match cap says where to continue from

The result gives the offset of the first match left behind, and a further search asking for that
offset returns the matches from there.

Only the match cap can be asked past. A walk that stopped short of the tree or ran out of time
reached neither the end of the matches nor a count of them, so it offers no later page and asks for
a narrower search as before.

An offset past the last match returns nothing and says how many matches there were, so that an
empty page cannot be read as the pattern having gone from the tree between two calls. A pattern that
is nowhere in the tree is an ordinary empty result at every offset: there is no page behind it to
say is still there.

Both of those reach the planner whether or not it may read the result, for the reason
[SEARCH-3](#SEARCH-3) gives about a notice written inside a body nobody is shown. A search is
quarantined by default, so a contract that held only for a trusted workspace would hold for the
minority of them.

**Why.** Narrowing the pattern or dropping to a subdirectory is otherwise the only way past the cap,
and it is a guess about where the matches that were cut off are. A guess that misses drops exactly
those, and nothing in the narrower result says so: it comes back complete, which reads as the whole
answer. A common word in a large tree then has as many matches as the cap allows that can be read
and an unknown number that cannot. This is the paging [read-file.md](read-file.md) gives a long
file, applied to a long list of matches.

The walk is repeated rather than resumed. A search holds no state between calls and visits files in
a fixed order, so counting to the offset again reaches the same match. A cursor would have to
survive between turns and still mean something after the tree changed underneath it. Reading every
file again is the cost of not keeping one.

<a id="SEARCH-9"></a>
### SEARCH-9: the caps a search runs under are configurable

`search.maxFiles` and `search.maxSeconds`, in the settings files, name how many files a search may
walk and how long it may spend opening them. Either may be raised as well as lowered, and a key
nobody set leaves the built-in cap in force. The two are independent, so a file naming one says
nothing about the other, in any layer.

A cap of zero is absence rather than a search permitted to read nothing, as is any value that is
not a whole count. Absence leaves the built-in cap in force, which is the cap a layer setting one
of those values gets rather than the number a weaker layer had named.

**Why.** The right number is a property of the tree, not of the program. The built-in caps are past
what a repository a person usually works in holds, and a monorepo, a tree of generated sources, or
a checkout on a network filesystem is where they are not: there every search comes back partial,
and a partial search is the answer that reads like a complete one. Nothing the program can measure
tells it which kind of tree it is in, which makes this configuration rather than a constant to pick
better.

Raising a cap does not unbound a search. The walk still stops at `maxFiles`, the reading still
stops at `maxSeconds`, and the match cap holds regardless of both, so the result is still the
bounded, deterministic, partial answer the clauses above describe.

The clock bounds the reading and not the walk, so `maxFiles` is what a very large tree is paid for
in: a walk of a million paths on a slow filesystem is a slow search rather than a truncated one,
and it is the number a person chose. That is the right way round, because a walk cut off by a clock
would keep a different part of the tree on every run, which is what the determinism above rules
out.

The caps are handed to the workspace by the caller that read the settings, rather than read by the
workspace itself. A workspace that consulted them would answer differently on a machine whose owner
had configured them, which is the one thing a test of a cap cannot have.

<a id="SEARCH-10"></a>
### SEARCH-10: a search may show the lines around each match

`context` is a count of lines to show before and after every match, at most ten and none unless
asked. The lines come from the file the walk already read, so the result keeps the label
[SEARCH-2](#SEARCH-2) gives it and nothing is opened or decided for them. A line that is itself a
match is shown once, as a match.

Context lines are not matches. They count toward neither the match cap nor the offset
([SEARCH-8](#SEARCH-8)), and a match skipped by an offset or left behind by the cap brings none. A
cap of its own bounds how many are returned, and one that stopped the lines around later matches
being added makes the search incomplete exactly as [SEARCH-3](#SEARCH-3) says of the other caps,
whether or not the planner may read the result.

**Why.** Understanding a hit otherwise costs a second call per hit, a round trip and a read of a
file the search had open. The match cap cannot bound the lines around matches: two hundred matches
with ten lines either side is four thousand lines, which the planner pays for in every later round,
hence a cap that is not the match cap. A cap that bit silently would leave later matches looking as
though nothing lay near them.

<a id="SEARCH-11"></a>
### SEARCH-11: `directory` may name one file

When `directory` resolves to a regular file inside the workspace, the search reads that file and
nothing else, and `include` is not consulted. The routing and permission checks that apply to a
walked file apply to it: the path must resolve inside the workspace, a `deny` rule covering it, under
the name given or the one it lands on, leaves nothing to search and is reported as in
[SEARCH-5](#SEARCH-5), and the result carries the label of that one file
([SEARCH-2](#SEARCH-2)). A file that holds no match reports no matches, since it was read. A
directory is searched as before.

**Why.** Searching a file already known by name otherwise takes its parent as `directory` and its
name as `include`, and a call that gives the file as `directory` fails. The argument stays routing:
it says where to look, and what it names is decided from the metadata of a path the routing gate has
already vouched for, never from the file's contents. A file named outright is searched even where a
walk from above would skip its directory ([SEARCH-7](#SEARCH-7)), as a directory named outright is.

<a id="SEARCH-12"></a>
### SEARCH-12: a search may return the files that match, or a count, instead of the lines

`output` is `lines` (what a search returns without it), `files` or `count`. `files` lists each file
holding a match once, and no line. `count` gives how many lines match in each such file and the
total. The value is a name from that closed set and nothing else, so one off the list is refused
rather than read as `lines`.

Both come from the same walk and match loop as the lines, so the result keeps the label
[SEARCH-2](#SEARCH-2) gives it: the paths and counts are computed from file contents by the
workspace and carried, never branched on by the driver, and they stay in the body and are
quarantined with it.

The match cap, the offset ([SEARCH-8](#SEARCH-8)) and `context` ([SEARCH-10](#SEARCH-10)) do not
apply, since no line is returned: a `count` totals every match the walk read, so it needs no offset
probe to learn how many there are. The file cap and the time cap of [SEARCH-3](#SEARCH-3) do. A
walk that stopped at either says the files and counts are a lower bound, whether or not the planner
may read the result. The listing has a cap of its own, and one that cut it short makes the search
incomplete; the total of a `count` is whole past it.

**Why.** A survey asks which files mention something, or how many places do. With only lines the
planner pays context for text it does not need and still reaches the match cap before it can say
how many there were. A partial list reads as a complete one, which is why the lower bound is said
and not left to be inferred.
