# Specs

Each file in this directory is a mini-spec for one topic within the bravebot system.
Spec changes, additions, and removals are closely reviewed by humans.

If a mini-spec disagrees, that is a bug in the spec that should be fixed.

Specs have automation attached which verifies that there is coverage of functionality and also
that functionality matches specs. Bugs are posted for any problems found.

One spec per tool. [tools/tool-surface.md](tools/tool-surface.md) is the table of all of them and
the routing-versus-content split they share.

Topics with no spec yet are ordinary code. Adding one is how a topic becomes review-required.

## Format

Front matter, then numbered clauses. Everything outside a clause is commentary and binds nobody.

- **`id`** is a short prefix. Clause ids are `PREFIX-N`, allocated in order and never reused and
  never renumbered, because a commit message, an issue, and a test name all point at one. A
  withdrawn clause stays, marked withdrawn, and says what replaced it.
- **Every clause carries an anchor**, `<a id="PREFIX-N"></a>` on the line directly above its
  heading, so `labels.md#LABEL-3` is a link that keeps working. The anchor GitHub generates from
  a heading contains the title, so it breaks the moment somebody improves the wording, which is
  the moment an issue or a commit pointing at that clause most needs the link to survive.
- **`governs`** lists the paths this spec decides. A diff touching one of them is reviewed against
  this file. Anything under no spec's `governs` is ordinary code and reviewed as such.
- **`guards`** lists symbols whose every use is review-required. An entry may also pin where it is
  used, as a `sites:` list of `path: count` items, and the check fails when the tree and the list
  disagree in either direction. The count is how many times the symbol occurs in that file's code:
  two uses on one line are two, one call rustfmt wrapped across three lines is one, and a comment
  naming the symbol is not a use of it at all. A count rather than a line number, so moving a call
  inside a file changes nothing, while adding or removing one is an edit to this spec that a
  reviewer sees. `make check-spec` prints the number it found, which is the number to record.
  Within one spec, either every entry pins its sites or none does: an unpinned entry beside pinned
  ones reads as though it were checked too.
- **`verified-by:`** lines name the tests that pin a clause, as `crate::module::test_name`. The
  coverage check reads them, fails when a name does not resolve to a test that exists, and posts a
  bug for any clause whose value is `none`. `by-construction` is for a clause nothing can execute,
  such as a crate having no dependencies, and says in brackets what makes it hold.

A clause is one rule, stated so that a reader can tell whether a given diff obeys it. If a clause
needs an "and" it is usually two clauses. A set of rules that reads best as a table is one clause with a
table in it, never a clause id per row: ids must be greppable one to a heading.

**Each spec stands alone.** A clause id is only ever cited inside its own file, where a reader can
scan for it. Never cite another spec's clause: somebody landing here first has no idea what
`TRUST-5` is, and chasing an id across files to understand one rule is how a set of small documents
becomes worse than one big one. Where a clause leans on something another spec owns, state the fact
plainly in a few words. "The same 'most specific wins' rule the trust map uses" costs a line and
needs no second tab.

**Point at documents, not at ids.** When a whole topic lives elsewhere, link the file by name:
`[trust-map.md](trust-map.md)`, not `` `TRUST` ``. A bare prefix means nothing to a first-time
reader, and it cannot be clicked.

**Clauses describe behaviour, not implementation.** Say what happens and why, never which function
or type does it. A clause naming a symbol becomes wrong the next time somebody renames one, and it
pins the code that exists rather than the behaviour the code owes. Identifiers belong in `governs`,
`guards` and `verified-by`, where tooling reads them and a rename is caught by the check rather
than by a reader noticing.
