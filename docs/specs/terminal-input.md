## Scope

What the user types into: how the box behaves, which keys do what, what the session takes from the
terminal to make any of it work, and where a terminal's own limits show through. What is drawn back is [terminal-transcript.md](terminal-transcript.md), and
pasting is [pasting.md](pasting.md).

## Clauses

<a id="INPUT-1"></a>
### INPUT-1: the box grows with the text, up to a cap

The cap is ten rows, enough for a substantial paragraph while the transcript keeps the majority of
a standard terminal. Beyond it the box scrolls to the cursor rather than growing further, and it
keeps growing while a turn runs. A long list of indicators leaves room for the box and the
transcript, and the box stays beneath the list.

**Why.** The line being composed is the one thing a person must always be able to see.

<a id="INPUT-2"></a>
### INPUT-2: Shift-Enter starts a line, Enter sends

Ctrl-J does the same thing everywhere and needs no terminal configuration, because most terminals
send the same byte for Enter whichever modifier was held. Both work while a turn runs and in shell
mode. A newline lands at the caret, does not arm shell mode, and Enter still sends a paragraph
written this way. Enter on an empty line does nothing.

<a id="INPUT-3"></a>
### INPUT-3: a marker is deletable, and deleting it takes the thing off

This holds for a folded paste, a pasted picture and a dropped file alike. It
is why a marker exists rather than a list the user cannot edit.

The row beneath the box goes with the marker. What is drawn there is what the line in the box
carries, so a file whose marker has been rubbed out is drawn nowhere, and one whose marker is still
there is drawn whether or not a turn is running.

**Why.** The turn was always built from the markers the line still held, so a deleted one already
sent nothing. What lingered was the row, which is the only place a person can see whether rubbing
the marker out worked: left drawn, it says a file is going that is not.

<a id="INPUT-4"></a>
### INPUT-4: the keys that stop, and the one that also leaves

Escape discards a half-typed prompt, and does nothing at all on a line with nothing on it. It
never ends the session. What it discards is kept as a draft for Up ([INPUT-39](#INPUT-39)), as is
the line the first Ctrl-C rung takes.

**Ctrl-C stops the nearest thing there is to stop, and leaves when there is nothing left.** It is
read against what is happening, in this order:

| What is happening | What Ctrl-C does |
|---|---|
| a turn in flight, or a command running | stops it, and the session stays where it was |
| nothing running, a line in the box | takes the line, and offers the way out |
| nothing running, an empty box | offers the way out |
| nothing running, an empty box, the way out already offered | ends the session |

**Nothing on this ladder ends the session on one press.** An interrupt is a single byte, and a
terminal delivers one byte stream without saying who wrote it, so a program able to write into the
pty can press this key: the editor that activates a virtualenv writes one before the line it types
(#403), and on the rung that left, that byte ended the session and handed the rest of the line back
to the shell. Every rung above the last one stops something a person asked for and still answers on
the first press, because those are recoverable and leaving is not. Ctrl-D is held to the same rule
for the same reason, being one byte that leaves an empty box.

**And neither half of that gesture is taken from a key that did not arrive on its own.** Asking for a
second press buys nothing against a writer that sends two, and two bytes in one write are no harder
to send than one: `\x03\x03` would otherwise arm the offer and take it. A run is one read of the
terminal, so everything in it was available at the same instant and no part of it is evidence separate
from the rest ([INPUT-34](#INPUT-34) is where a run is defined). A key that arrived with others
therefore reaches the rungs that stop something, which are recoverable, and not the rung that leaves.
This costs a person nothing, since the run a program sent has ended before they press anything.

**The offer is withdrawn by any input that is not one of the two keys that leave**, a mouse report, a
resize and words another program typed among them, not only by another key. It answers the press just
made, and one left standing through ten minutes of scrolling would let a byte written at the end of
them take it. **Letting go of a key is not such input**, whichever key it was and whichever modifiers
it still carried: a release is the tail of the press being answered, and a person who lets go of the
modifier before the letter must not thereby lose the way out.

**What none of this buys: a program can still stop a turn in flight.** The guard is on the rung that
leaves and on no other, and the reason is not that stopping a turn is cheap. It is what the guard would
have to refuse to be worth having.

A key that **starts** something can wait. The return that sends a line and the key that grants a
directory both hand something to the rest of the program that was not there before, and refusing one
costs a person one more press and a line saying which, with the line still in front of them. A key that
**stops** something cannot wait: somebody watching a turn go wrong has to stop it on the first press,
and refusing theirs because the terminal happened to deliver a resize in the same read would take the
interrupt away at the moment it is most wanted. The asymmetry is in what the refusal costs, not in what
the key costs.

It would also buy nothing. The interrupt an editor writes arrives on its own, so a guard asking whether
it arrived alone passes it, and Escape stops a turn on one byte as well, or on two from vi's INSERT
mode ([INPUT-24](#INPUT-24)). **So an editor writing `\x03`
or `\x1b` into the terminal stops whatever is running, and nothing here prevents it.** What bounds the
damage is that a stopped turn puts its prompt back where the box can take it, so the loss is the tokens
and the time rather than the work. That is a bound and not a defence, and it is written here so nobody
reads the rung that leaves as protecting the rest of the ladder.

Escape only ever stops, and never leaves. A summary is the one exception to the table: it is a
single request with no round for a stop to land between, so nothing there can stop it and Ctrl-C
leaves once it comes back. An aside is such a request too, and so is the check a goal is judged by,
which [goal.md](goal.md) governs. What the table leaves out of all three is a mode: a scroller, a
delegate's view or a prompt search open over the request answers both keys itself, exactly as it
does over a turn, and the press that reaches the request is the one after the mode has closed.

Taking the line says so, on the line beneath the box, and says which key ends the session. The
offer lives for exactly one press, since it answers the press just made and the next press is the
answer to it. **An empty box says the same thing**, in the same words and for a stronger reason: a
press that appeared to do nothing and said nothing reads as an interface that has stopped
responding. Any key that is not itself one of the two that leave withdraws the offer, so a press now
and a byte written later are not the two halves of one gesture.

**A turn asked to stop says so until it ends.** From the press that asks for the stop, the working
indicator names the stop ahead of every other word it would use, and keeps naming it until the turn
ends. While delegates the turn started are still running, the word says how many, and the count
falls as they return. A further press while the turn is stopping finds the same word, since it asks
for the stop already underway. The ladder is unchanged: the mark is what the screen says, not a rung.

**Why.** A turn ends once its worker and every delegate it started have returned, which can take
seconds. An indicator still naming the work through that wait reads as a press nobody heard, and
the person presses again, toward the presses at an empty box that end the session.

**Stopping shows a cancelled status, and the prompt comes back when the box can take it.**
The reply stops arriving. When no work followed the prompt, no prompts are queued, and the box is
empty, the prompt returns for editing. The status identifies a deliberate cancellation rather than
a failure or a completed answer.
Dropped files and pasted pictures return with their markers, keeping their identities and order
within each attachment store. Resubmitting includes each once in the new submission, in the
request order described by [dropping.md](dropping.md). Editor attachment stores remain in memory
only.

**A stop withdraws the questions a turn asks after it.** Delegates share one confirmer and take
turns at it, so when a stop answers one delegate's prompt, the next delegate's question is already on
its way. It is declined as that stop declined the first, and is never drawn, so one press stops the
turn however many delegates were waiting.

The prompt stays sent, marked stopped, where any of three things is true: the turn had already
done something that is on the screen, there are prompts waiting behind it, or the box is not empty.
The first two mean there is an order to keep, and a line put back in the box would be out of it.
The third is a box that is taken: what is in it is the line the person is looking at, whether they
typed it during the turn or walked back to it, so the prompt has nowhere to be put back to. Taking
it out of the transcript as well would leave no record of what was asked. Recalling an earlier
prompt is separate: [sessions.md](sessions.md) takes a cancelled prompt out of recall even where
its transcript entry stays.

**Nothing waits out work that is only being waited on.** A reply stops whether or not it has begun
arriving, and whether it is the planner's or a processor's; a running command is killed; a pause
between retries is abandoned; and nothing new is sent once a stop has landed. What still finishes
is a tool call already running, because stopping one part way could leave a file half written.

A request being waited on is walked away from rather than interrupted, since a read in progress
cannot be interrupted. The socket is left to be closed when the far end finishes or the connection
times out, which is sound because reading a reply applies nothing and decides nothing.

**Why.** A stop noticed only between rounds would leave the reply streaming to the end while the
screen said "cancelling…". The key meant to stop the answer would leave the answer running and put
a progress report on the screen about a key press, and the longer the reply the longer somebody
waits for the thing they have already stopped.

**Why.** The press somebody makes while an answer is going wrong in front of them is asking for
the answer to stop, not for the session to end, and answering it by leaving takes the transcript
and everything else with it. Ctrl-C is also how a person leaves a terminal program, which is the
other half: it leaves from an empty box, so both requests have a key.

This is not the arrangement where a key pressed twice means two different things by accident. Each
press has something of its own to answer and the state says which, so no press is one that
silently did another one's job. What makes the ladder safe to walk is that each rung is visible:
the turn stopping is on the screen, and the line going says what the next press will do.

Escape used to leave as well, once the line was empty. That made every press a question of what
was in the box: the key for abandoning a thought ended the session as soon as the thought was
short enough, and pressing it twice in a row meant two different things, the second of which was
the exit. One way out, and it is the one people already reach for.

### INPUT-5: where a chord cannot reach the process, the fallback is documented rather than silent

Shift-Enter needs a terminal that reports the modifier (Ghostty, Kitty, WezTerm) or one configured
to send a newline; Ctrl-J is the fallback that always works (INPUT-2). Command-V never reaches the
process and can carry only text, so Ctrl-V is the key for a picture, and which key
carries a picture is said once per session. Ctrl-Enter (INPUT-36) needs the same kind of terminal, or
Windows, which reports the modifier without being asked. Elsewhere it arrives as Enter and only
queues the line, so the offer beside the queue is not drawn there, and the way to the same turn is
Up, then Escape, then Enter. From vi's INSERT mode that Escape is two presses (INPUT-24).

**Why.** A chord that silently does nothing reads as a broken feature.

<a id="INPUT-6"></a>
### INPUT-6: a marker is deleted whole, in one press

Backspace and Delete each take the whole of the marker the caret covers, and Backspace takes the
whole of one it sits just after, whether it stands for a folded paste, a pasted picture or a
dropped file. A covered marker goes before the character in front of it, because it is the thing
the caret is on. Only a marker the box wrote goes this way: square brackets the user typed are
deleted a character at a time, as everything they typed is.

**Why.** A marker is one thing on the screen and one thing to the person looking at it. Taking a
character off the end leaves text that still reads as an attachment standing over something no
longer attached, and the only way to find that out is to keep pressing.

<a id="INPUT-7"></a>
### INPUT-7: the caret steps over a marker whole, and never rests inside one

One press of Left or Right crosses a marker in either direction, and there is no position within
one for the caret to stop at. Up and Down keep their place along the line, and where that place
falls inside a marker the caret comes to rest on the marker instead.

**Why.** A caret between two halves of a picture is in a place the person cannot see, and whatever
they type next lands there. Counting out the characters a marker happens to be spelled with is a
dozen presses to cross what reads as a single word.

<a id="INPUT-8"></a>
### INPUT-8: the caret is drawn over the whole marker it is on

Every cell of the marker is covered, including the part of one the box wrapped onto the next row.

**Why.** The caret says what the next press acts on. A block over the opening bracket alone says
the next press takes a bracket, which is the thing that no longer happens.

<a id="INPUT-9"></a>
### INPUT-9: the box behaves the same whether or not a turn is running

Typing, editing, pasting, dropping a file, putting a line away, walking back through earlier
prompts, scrolling the transcript, asking what a turn has done, choosing how much the session asks
before it acts, and asking what the keys are all do while a turn is in flight exactly what they do at
rest. What a running turn refuses is **sending**, and the keys allowed to mean something else are
named here and nowhere else:

| Key | Why it may differ |
|---|---|
| Enter | sends, which is the whole of what is refused (INPUT-10), and a line that is one of the words a slash may begin is carried out as it is typed or waits to be, never sent ([commands.md](commands.md#CMD-8)) |
| Escape, Ctrl-C | stop the turn in flight (INPUT-4), Escape in vi's style only from NORMAL mode with nothing waiting, and Ctrl-`[` with it ([INPUT-24](#INPUT-24)) |
| Ctrl-Enter | queues the line as Enter does, then stops the turn in flight so what is waiting goes now (INPUT-36) |
| Ctrl-D | leaves, which is not something the box does |
| Ctrl-G | hands the screen the turn is drawing on to an editor (INPUT-14) |
| `!` | arms a mode that changes what Enter does, over whatever the box holds when the turn ends ([shell-mode.md](shell-mode.md)) |
| Up | takes back what is waiting before it walks the history (INPUT-18) |

**What is offered beneath the box while work runs is the commands and the list of keys.** A line
that is a slash word alone is offered the commands it could become, with the rows and keys it has at
rest, because Enter carries a command out or queues it ([CMD-8](commands.md#CMD-8)) and a person has
to be able to find the word. Each row says whether Enter on it runs the command now or waits for the
turn. Nothing else is offered to complete: not the skills, which are not read while work runs, and
not files. The list of keys (INPUT-13) is documentation somebody asked for, and it is drawn whether
or not a turn is running.

**Why.** The box took nothing at all mid-turn once, and it was opened up a piece at a time:
characters, then editing, then pasting. Walking the history was left behind, so a person could
compose a new prompt during a turn but could not reach the one they had just sent, which is the
one they want most when a turn is going wrong in front of them. The keys reached no arm and did
nothing at all, not even the scrolling they fall through to at rest.

A difference between the two has to be a difference about sending, and it has to be in the table.
The two paths therefore answer the same **set** of keys rather than one list each: a test that
walked six key codes said nothing whatever about the keys that were not among them, and three keys
that send nothing were answered by the idle path alone for exactly as long as that. Two of the three
were advertised on every frame of a running turn by the hint line and by the list, so the keys a
person was most likely to reach for while a turn went wrong were the ones that did nothing.

Worst of the three was a key whose flag was set and whose answer was refused a place on the screen.
The press did nothing a person could see, and the list came up when the turn ended, unasked and
attached to no press.

### INPUT-10: a prompt sent while a turn runs goes into that turn, at its next round boundary

Enter mid-turn takes the line out of the box and holds it. It is drawn under the box, marked, so
the person can see that what they sent went somewhere.

**A line that is a command is never sent.** Most are taken the same way and wait to be carried
out: such a line comes off the box and is drawn under it like anything else waiting, but it is not
offered to the turn in flight, so nothing about it reaches the planner. What carries it out is the
queue being reached once the turn has ended, and a prompt behind it goes when it has, as any waiting
prompt does. A command that reads or changes only what the session keeps is carried out as it is
typed instead. Which lines are commands, and which of them wait, is
[commands.md](commands.md#CMD-8)'s.

**The turn in flight takes it.** A turn asks between rounds, after the round's tool calls have run
and before the next request goes out, and everything waiting goes into the conversation there, in
the order it was typed. So an instruction reaches the planner while the work it is about is still
happening. A prompt still waiting when the turn ends becomes a turn of its own, as every queued
prompt used to, and the rest go on waiting under the same rule.

**Why.** A prompt that waits for the turn to end is not an instruction, it is a comment. Somebody
watching an agent read the wrong file and typing "no, the other one" is talking about what is
happening now; delivered after the answer, it arrives after the thing it was meant to prevent, and
the work it would have redirected has been done. This is what Claude Code does, and for this reason.

**The mark says where the line is going.** Beside it, one of five: into this turn at its next
round, for a prompt behind a turn that will take it; as a turn of its own afterwards, for the first
prompt behind something that will not, which is a request of its own such as `/compact`, a plan or
a goal check, or a turn the person has asked to stop; into the next turn, for a prompt behind that
one, since only the prompt that begins a turn leaves the queue it reads; carried out after this,
for a command; run in the person's shell, for a command line. A turn asked to stop is drawn as one
from the press that asked, since it takes nothing at the boundary it stops at and the interface
hears that it has stopped only once it has. The words say what the next round will do, and a turn
that answers without another has no next round: what was going into it waits instead, and the first
of it becomes a turn of its own. Where the width will not hold the words they are left out whole,
and the mark stands alone. On the last row they share the width with the key that sends the queue
now (INPUT-36). Each is short enough that an 80-column row holds both, and where a row does not, the
key keeps its place and the words go.

**Why.** Whether a correction is about to be read is what decides whether to stop the turn over it.
A mark saying only that the line waits leaves that to a guess, and the guess that it will be read is
wrong behind a `/compact` or a turn already stopping, in the direction that costs: the person waits
for a correction that is not coming. Cut short, the words could say the same wrong thing by
stopping at "into this". The key outranks them on the last row because it is the one way to hurry
what is waiting, and the rows above it still say where theirs are going.

**The turn in flight is the one on the screen.** Work handed out to a delegate is a turn of its own,
and the person typing may not know one is running at all, so what they send waits for the turn they
are watching rather than going to the delegate. A delegate does not ask for one either: the queue is
shared and asking is taking, so a delegate that asked and then declined what it was handed would
throw the line away, leaving the turn it was aimed at to find nothing waiting. A round a turn spends
waiting for a delegate is a round of that turn, and the boundary it reaches when the delegate is back
asks like any other: a turn that answered with nothing in order to wait and then went straight on to
its next request would put the delegate's report to the planner and nothing of what the person made
of it.

Not mid-round. Every call the planner asked for in a round runs, because a round is a set of calls
asked for together and answering some while abandoning others leaves calls unanswered. Stopping in
the middle of one is what the keys in INPUT-4 are for.

**It may not route.** Routing is precommitted from the prompt that began the turn and stays that
way, so an interjection reaches the planner as words to read and every effect it goes on to ask for
is gated against the routing the turn began with. It is trusted, on the footing of the opening
prompt and by the same act, since a keystroke has no author but the person at the keyboard. The
audit trail records it as the user's own input, so a turn that changed course halfway through does
not read as one that thought of it unprompted. See [routing.md](routing.md).

**What it carries is text.** A turn already running cannot be handed a file or a picture: it fixed
the shape of its context before it read anything. So markers resolve to words when the line is sent,
and the person keeps looking at what they typed: a dropped file resolves to its name, which the
planner can go and read. See [dropping.md](dropping.md).

A waiting prompt is **not** in the transcript. It has not happened; it moves there at the moment the
planner is given it, whether that is inside the running turn or as a turn of its own, and it is
drawn as waiting only until then. What it names is settled when it is queued, not when it is sent,
because a file the person took off the line afterwards was never part of that prompt. It is in the
prompt history from the moment it is queued, since from the person's side that is when they sent it.

Stopping a turn leaves the queue alone. The turn being stopped takes nothing from it, even at a
boundary it reaches after the stop because the stop came while the round's last call ran and that
call did not say so. The next waiting prompt begins its turn as it would after any turn, and the
rest go on waiting in order. A prompt is taken back out of the queue by asking
for it (INPUT-18), and until then it goes.

The stopped prompt does **not** come back to the box when something is waiting. It stays in the
transcript as sent, marked stopped, and the box stays empty for whatever the person types next.

**Why.** A stop is aimed at the turn in flight, and nothing else. The prompts behind it are ones
the person typed and has not taken back, so throwing them away made stopping a turn that had gone
wrong cost every prompt they had queued while it went wrong, which is a reason not to press the
key at all.

Un-sending it in front of them would be worse than losing it. The conversation has to read in the
order it happened, and a prompt lifted back out of it while the two typed after it are still
running is in neither place: gone from the transcript, and sitting in a box that is about to be
wanted for the next thing.

An interjection this turn already took keeps it sent too, although taking it left nothing waiting.
It is in the conversation the turn carries on with and it is in the transcript where it was said, so
neither prompt moves: handing the opening one back to the box would leave its own entry above as
sent, and lifting the interjection out to make room would take back a line the planner has read.

Shift-Enter still starts a line rather than sending it, so a paragraph can be written mid-turn and
is not sent half-finished.

**Why.** Enter mid-turn used to reach nothing at all. The line stayed in the box until the person
noticed the turn had ended and pressed it again, which is indistinguishable from a key press that
was ignored. This does not weaken what a running turn refuses: a second turn still cannot begin
while the first is in flight, and the queue is what makes that refusal visible instead of silent.

### INPUT-11: what is attached is drawn nearest the box, above what is waiting

The rows beneath the box run in one order: what the line in the box carries, then the prompts
waiting for the turn in flight, then what the half-typed line could still become.

**Why.** An attachment is part of the line still being composed, and the prompts below it have
already gone. Drawn the other way round, a file staged during a turn sat underneath prompts it
was no part of, which reads as though it went with one of them, and the row for the file the
person had just dropped moved further from the box with every prompt they queued.

### INPUT-12: an empty box says what it is for

An invitation stands in the empty box, behind the same prompt character a typed line gets and in
the column the first character will land in, with the caret on it. The first thing typed takes its
place and nothing on the row moves. It is drawn rather than typed, so it is never part of a prompt
and never has to be deleted. Shell mode has none: the line there is a command, and its own prompt
character, colour and hint line all say so.

**Why.** An empty box says nothing about what it takes, and the one thing somebody opening this
for the first time needs to know is that they may simply ask.

<a id="INPUT-13"></a>
### INPUT-13: `?` on an empty line lists every key, and the hint line says only that

The marker is a mode rather than a character, as `!` is (INPUT-2, [shell-mode.md](shell-mode.md)):
nothing is typed into the box, the invitation stays where it was, and there is nothing to delete
afterwards. A second `?` takes the list down, as does Escape or typing anything else. Only on an
empty line, since a `?` in a sentence is the punctuation somebody is asking a question with, and in
shell mode it is a glob for the shell to expand.

**A line arriving in the box takes the list down**, whichever path put it there: recall, a stashed
line coming back, the queue coming back, an editor, or a stopped turn handing its prompt back. The
list stands over the box, so one left up over a line that arrived under it belongs to a press two
prompts ago.

The list is not a completion. There is nothing in it to choose, so Tab and the arrows go on meaning
what they mean everywhere else while it is up.

It is the one place the keys are written down, so a binding that changes cannot leave the list
advertising something that no longer works. It folds into as many columns as the width holds, and no
row runs past the edge: a row that wrapped would put the list a row over the height reserved for it
and push the hint line off the screen.

The hint line carries what the session is doing (the mode in force where it is not asking, the
trail, how full the context is and on what footing it knows that, INPUT-22, a loop that is running
and when its next tick is due, [loop.md](loop.md), how many background jobs the turn has running,
[RUN-26](tools/run.md#RUN-26), the key that opens the delegates where the
session has spawned any, the key that moves the command the turn is waiting on to the background
while it can be moved, [RUN-25](tools/run.md#RUN-25)), then `? for shortcuts`, and then the key
that opens the info panel while the panel is closed and the terminal is wide enough for it
([PANEL-7](info-panel.md#PANEL-7)). It lists no other binding of its own, and it does not report the
confinement. While the info panel is drawn, how full the context is and the cache figure are in the
panel and not on the line ([PANEL-8](info-panel.md#PANEL-8)). The trail key is named only **once a turn has left a trail to look at**: a trail is
recorded when the turn it belongs to ends, so before then the line would be offering a press that
changes nothing on screen. The move key is named for the same reason **only while there is a
command it would move**, and is gone once it has been pressed or the command has ended.

The mode leads the line and is the only part of it drawn in a colour, and asking takes no room at
all: what is drawn is a mode somebody chose, named in [permission-modes.md](permission-modes.md). A
marker standing there on every session is one people stop reading, and being read is the whole of
what this one is for.

**What does not fit is dropped whole, at a separator.** The parts are given up in order (the key that
opens the info panel, then a reading with no figure in it, then the way to the bindings, then the trail key, then the figures, then the
move key, then the count of jobs, and a running loop after all of them), and the mode is the last to
go. The move key is
kept that late because it is up only while somebody is waiting on a command, which is when they read
this line for a way out of the wait. The loop is kept that late because
it is the only part of the line spending something while nobody is watching, and it is given up at
all because a part nothing may give up would have a narrow terminal clear the whole row and take the
mode with it. The count of jobs goes just before the loop for the loop's reason: a job runs while nobody
watches it, and once the block that started it has scrolled away nothing else on the screen says it
runs. It is counted from the driver's events and never from anything a job printed. In shell mode
the line is the shell's own, and the loop and the count of jobs are said there too, since a loop
spends a turn and a job runs whichever mode the box is in. A note about what a press just did, drawn at the right of
the same row,
takes its room ahead of all of them: the parts are fitted against the width it leaves, since a part
fitted against the whole width is one the note writes over the middle of. Left to the
terminal, the line is cut wherever the final column falls, which puts half a word under the box:
that reads as a rendering fault, where a part that is simply absent reads as a line with no room,
which is the truth.

**Why.** The bindings and the state were on one line together, and the line was wider than the
terminal, so the end of it was cut. Everything a person could look up was taking room from the two
figures they had no other way to see. A binding cut off is one somebody learns once; a context
reading cut off is gone. Moving the bindings behind a key they can press when they want them is what
lets the line fit a terminal eighty wide whole.

The confinement is settled by the platform before the session opens and cannot change while it
runs, so a line reporting it on every frame spends room on a constant. The mark states it once at
startup and `/status` answers for it whenever somebody asks. The delegate key earns the room
instead, because it is the one thing here whose answer changes and which nothing else on a
finished screen says.

The mode outranks all of it because it is the one thing here that changes what the next keystroke
does. A person who cannot see that writes are going through unasked is the case this line exists to
prevent, and a mode read off `/status` after the write is a mode read too late.

### INPUT-14: Ctrl-G edits the line in the user's own editor, and only what was saved comes back

The editor opens on what has been typed so far, so the key continues a prompt rather than starting
it again, and what was saved replaces the line. Quitting without saving leaves the line exactly as
it was, and so does an editor that failed or was killed: neither says anything about what the user
wanted. The trailing newline an editor leaves is dropped, one only, and line endings come back the
way a paste's do. The file the editor opened is the user's own words, is readable by nobody else,
and does not outlive the edit down any path. The key does nothing while a turn runs.

**Why.** A prompt worth thinking about outgrows a box ten rows tall with nothing to search or
reflow with. The failure that matters is the one that blanks a paragraph somebody just wrote, so
every path that does not end in a save ends in the line untouched. Handing the terminal to an
editor mid-turn would take the screen from the turn drawing on it.

### INPUT-15: `$VISUAL`, then `$EDITOR`, then a list that prefers a full editor to a last resort

An empty value is not an answer, since exporting a variable to nothing is how a profile takes one
back. With neither set, what opens is the first of `vim`, `vi`, `emacs`, `nano` that is installed,
in that order. A configured editor that will not start is reported as such and nothing else is
tried. An editor that returns before the file has been edited is told to wait, but only where the
user wrote no arguments of their own.

**Why.** Someone with `vim` or `emacs` on their machine chose to install it and will not thank a
guess for opening something else; `nano` is the last resort, for the person who has none of them.
Falling back past a name the user exported would run an editor they did not ask for and blame their
configuration for it. A GUI editor that exits the moment its window opens returns the line
unchanged with nothing anywhere saying why, which is neither a failure nor an edit.

### INPUT-16: an editor is started under the name it was asked for

A name is looked for where a shell would look for it, and what runs is that name and not the file a
symlink behind it points at. The name is only kept while it still reaches the same program: a link
that now points elsewhere, or one that no longer resolves, is started by resolved path instead. This
is the editor alone. Everywhere a program is approved before it runs, the approval names the file
that ran, because a name can be repointed afterwards.

**Why.** MacVim installs `vim`, `vi` and `gvim` as links to a single shim that reads its own
`argv[0]`, stays in the terminal for the `vi*` spellings and forks a detached GUI window for the
`m*` and `g*` ones. Started through the resolved path it is always `mvim`, so asking for `vim` opened
a window, returned at once, and put the prompt back unedited with nothing saying why. An editor is
started rather than approved, and for it the name is part of what the user asked for.

### INPUT-17: Ctrl-S puts the line away, and puts it back

One key, read against the line rather than remembered. A line in the box is put away and the box is
emptied; an empty box is where a line put away earlier comes back, with the caret at its end, where
somebody carries on typing. There is one place to put a line, so a second line put away replaces the
first, and a line that comes back is no longer there to come back again: the next press on the empty
box it left has nothing to do, and says nothing. A prompt walked back to is the one line the key does
not put away, and means the search there instead (INPUT-31).

**The words travel and the mode does not.** What is put away is what the user typed, and `!` is a
mode rather than a character (INPUT-2, [shell-mode.md](shell-mode.md)), so it stays where they left
it. A prompt comes back into an armed shell as the command they are writing now, and a command comes
back onto an ordinary prompt as words. The list of keys goes, as it does for anything else that
rewrites the box.

**Nothing is sent, so a turn in flight refuses none of it** (INPUT-9). What a line names is settled
when it is sent and not when it is put away, so a marker in a stashed line stands for something still
staged, and names it again when the words holding it come back.

**A line put away says so, on one row beneath the box, and says which key returns it.** One row
however long the line was, above the prompts that are waiting and below what the line in the box
carries (INPUT-11). No row runs past the edge, and where the width will not hold both, the words stay
and the reminder goes: which line is waiting is the part only this row can say, and the key is in the
list `?` puts up as well.

**Why.** A better thought arrives while a worse one is half written, most often during a turn, and
the two ways out were sending the first or losing it. Escape and Ctrl-C are not a third: they clear
the line, and keep it only as the draft Up returns ([INPUT-39](#INPUT-39)), which is a different
place from this one. The stash is a line put away on purpose, kept until it is brought back and
replaced only by another press of this key. The draft is a line cleared, replaced by the next clear
and dropped by any send. Merging them would let a slip of Escape overwrite a line put away
deliberately, or let Ctrl-S bring back a line it never put away.

The row is the whole of what makes the key safe to press. A press that emptied the box and said
nothing is indistinguishable from one that threw a paragraph away, and the only way to find out
which it had been was to press again and hope. Naming the line is what turns the key from a guess
into a place a thought is being kept.

The caret is not carried. It belongs to an edit that has finished, and restoring it would put a
person back in the middle of a sentence they have not looked at since.

### INPUT-18: Up takes back what is waiting before it walks the history

While prompts are waiting, Up puts all of them back into the box in one press, in the order they
were typed, one to a line. Nothing is waiting afterwards, so the rows under the box that said so
go with them. A half-typed line stays below them, where the caret is. What each of them named
comes back staged with it, so a marker in a line that comes back stands for the same file or
picture it stood for when it went. They stay in the prompt history, since from the person's side
they were sent and taking them back does not unsay them.

**Only what the planner has not been given.** A prompt the running turn has already taken
(INPUT-10) cannot be taken back, because it is in the conversation: offering it to the box would
leave the person editing a line that had gone, and sending it again would say it twice. Taking one
back that the turn has *not* reached puts it out of the turn's reach as well, or the key would read
as having done nothing: the line in the box, and the copy arriving at the planner a moment later.
Where the turn has taken every waiting prompt, the press leaves the box exactly as it was.

With nothing waiting the key is unchanged: it walks the history, and scrolls once there is nothing
left to walk. Inside a paragraph it moves between rows first, and reaches the queue from the top
row, the way it reaches the history there.

**Why.** Up is how a person reaches for the last thing they said, and while something is waiting
the last thing they said is in the queue. The history holds a copy of every queued line from the
moment it is queued (INPUT-10), so the key handed back a copy: the person rewrote it, sent it, and
the original went as well. The only way to take a queued prompt back was to stop the turn in
flight, which is aimed at something else entirely and costs the answer being written.

### INPUT-38: Ctrl-Y puts back what the last Ctrl-U, Ctrl-K, Ctrl-W or Alt-D took

Ctrl-U, Ctrl-K, Ctrl-W and Alt-D (the word after the caret and the blanks before it) keep what they
delete, and Ctrl-Y inserts it at the caret, leaving the caret after it. Kills that go the same way and
follow each other join, as in readline: backward kills (Ctrl-U, Ctrl-W) put the later text first,
forward kills (Ctrl-K, Alt-D) put it last. A kill the other way, or one after any edit or caret move,
starts a new buffer. Ctrl-Y with nothing kept does nothing. Alt-Y does not cycle through earlier kills.

The buffer is vi's register ([INPUT-28](#INPUT-28)), so Ctrl-Y puts back what `d` or `y` took, and `p`
puts back what a kill took, as characters. A kill never changes what `p` does with text `d` or `y`
took. Ctrl-Y inserts a register that holds whole lines as its characters, without the newline. A
marker that was killed comes back as the marker, and names its attachment again for as long as that is
still staged; once it is not, it is text like any other ([INPUT-3](#INPUT-3)). A chord moved onto
`ctrl-y` ([INPUT-32](#INPUT-32)) is read first, and `yank` is not one of the ten movable actions.
While `R` is typing over the line ([INPUT-37](#INPUT-37)), Ctrl-U and Ctrl-W are Backspace and keep
nothing, and Alt-D does nothing.

**Why.** The three delete keys threw their text away, so moving a clause with the readline keys was not
possible; Claude Code and Codex keep it and paste it with Ctrl-Y. One buffer for removed text keeps vi
and readline from disagreeing about what was last taken.

## Known costs

- **A stopped request leaves a thread and a socket behind.** The reply goes on being read by
  nobody until the far end finishes or the connection times out, which can be minutes on a
  connection that has died. It costs a thread and a socket for that long, and it is the price of
  answering the person at once: the alternative is waiting for a read that cannot be interrupted.
  Nothing that thread does is visible, since it holds no policy, no workspace and no tool.
- **Asking the terminal about itself at startup can eat what was typed into that moment.** The
  question about the background is asked once, before the first frame, and the answer is read off
  the tty directly. Anything typed or pasted in the window before the answer arrives is read by
  that same call and discarded, and a terminal that answers with nothing keeps the window open for
  its full 80 ms. It is bounded, it is once per session, and it is before there is a box to type
  into, which is why it is a cost and not a clause.
- **Ctrl-S is the byte a terminal traditionally freezes its output with.** It reaches this process
  because raw mode turns that flow control off for as long as the session holds the terminal, which
  is what makes the chord bindable at all (INPUT-17). The cost is a person's muscle memory: somewhere
  behind a `tmux` or `screen` configured to keep flow control, or an ssh session that does, the key
  can be taken before it arrives, and then it does nothing here. Nothing is lost when that happens,
  since the line stays in the box.
- **A prompt walked back to is the one line that cannot be put away.** The key opens the search there
  instead (INPUT-31), so parking a recalled prompt while something else is typed is a thing the stash
  slot no longer does. What it buys is the search being one key from the walk, which is what makes the
  prompt cheap to reach again: a word typed into the search rather than the walk over again. Touching
  the line is the way to the old meaning, an edit being what ends the walk (INPUT-17).
- **A selection is one stretch of the line and never a column of it.** Vi's block-wise selection,
  which reaches the same columns of several rows, has no equivalent here: what `v` and `V` mark out
  runs from one position to another (INPUT-30). The cost is a person's muscle memory for one chord,
  and it buys a selection that is a pair of offsets rather than a rectangle every operator would have
  to understand separately. A box ten rows tall holding one prompt is also not where somebody edits
  columns of a table.
- **A panic leaves the terminal taken.** Every path that returns hands it back (INPUT-33), and a
  panic returns through none of them: the process ends on the alternate screen, in raw mode, with
  mouse reporting on, and the shell that started it is left needing `reset`. The message that says
  what went wrong is on the screen thrown away with it, which is the worse half. A process-wide
  hook is not the answer on its own: a turn runs off the main thread, and a panic there is a turn
  that failed rather than a session that ended, so a hook that handed the terminal back would do it
  underneath an interface still drawing on it.
- **This interface owns the whole terminal while it runs.** The transcript is a viewport repainted
  in place on a screen of its own rather than lines added to the terminal's scrollback (INPUT-33),
  so what leaves the top of it is reachable through this program's own scroller and through nothing
  else, and a screen repainted in place is not a document a screen reader can follow. What that
  costs is a mode rather than the program: `--plain` is the same session in lines
  ([cli.md](cli.md)), and what it gives up is everything this interface draws, the scroller and its
  search, the key list, the slash commands, `@` naming a file, a picture on the clipboard, and a
  session record to pick up again. So the cost is having to choose, and neither half is the whole
  program.
- **Vi's editing is what this box does with the keys, not what vi does with a file.** There is one
  register rather than named ones, no macro and no mark, and there is no `:` line. Each of those is
  machinery for a file being edited over an afternoon, where this is a prompt being written over a
  minute. The keys that reach for a register, a macro or a mark do nothing, and nor does the key
  after them (INPUT-23). `:` is the exception: it does nothing, and what is typed after it is read as
  the instructions those letters spell. Counts are not on this list, because a count is how a person
  says how far, and a prompt has as much room to go as a file has (INPUT-35). Nor is how far back `u`
  reaches, which is as far as vim's. Redo is missing for another reason: its key is the prompt search
  (INPUT-19), so what `u` took back is typed again (INPUT-28).
- **The key list names Ctrl-Enter on every terminal.** Where the terminal does not report the
  modifier the chord arrives as Enter and only queues the line (INPUT-5). The offer beside the queue,
  which is where somebody reaches for it, is left off there; the list is drawn from one table for
  every terminal, as it is for Shift-Enter.

<a id="INPUT-19"></a>
### INPUT-19: Ctrl-R searches every prompt sent, and what is chosen goes into the box

Ctrl-R opens a search over the prompt history, at rest and while a turn is running, and closes it
again along with Escape and Ctrl-C. It opens on the newest prompt, seeded with whatever single line
the person typed into the box, and with nothing where that line is a prompt walked back to: the
history put that one there whole, and a search looking for it answers with it alone. While it is open
every letter narrows the list rather than reaching the box, and each word typed has to appear
somewhere in a prompt for it to be offered; the arrows walk the matches, Ctrl-S swaps between every
prompt and the ones sent from this workspace, and backspacing past the start closes the search as the
scroller's does. The chord is on the key list (INPUT-13), and in the border of the box while an older
prompt is being walked back to, which is the moment somebody has shown they want one, except where
that border is too narrow to hold it beside which prompt is being shown (INPUT-31).

Enter puts the prompt under the cursor into the box. It does not send it, and it replaces what was
in the box, that line being what the search was seeded with or the prompt the walk put there.

**Why.** Up walks one prompt at a time, which is the right way in when the wanted prompt is the last
one and no way in at all when it is the hundredth: what a person remembers of an old prompt is a
word out of the middle of it rather than how far back it was. Ctrl-R because every shell answers
that chord with this question.

A stored prompt is content, not an instruction: the file can be edited, on a shared machine by
somebody else. Landing it in the box rather than in a request means the keystroke that sends it is
the person's own, after they have read it, exactly as if they had typed it
([sessions.md](sessions.md)).

Mid-turn is when the wanted prompt is most likely to be one that has scrolled away, and searching
sends nothing, which is the whole of what a running turn refuses (INPUT-9). Escape and Ctrl-C reach
the search before they reach the turn, so the key that closes it leaves the turn running and the
press that stops the turn is the next one. A turn is not the only thing they reach it before: the
summary, the aside and the goal check each hold a request of their own, and the search is open over
those the same way.

<a id="INPUT-20"></a>
### INPUT-20: the list says which prompt each row is

The search is drawn over the transcript in place of the box, newest at the bottom. Each row carries
how long ago that prompt was sent, and nothing where the entry predates times being kept. The
prompt under the cursor is drawn in full beside the list, with a word for how many lines did not
fit; where the terminal is too narrow for two columns the list is what is kept. A window over more
matches than fit says so, the scope in force is named, and a search matching nothing says that
rather than showing an empty panel.

**Why.** A row is one line of what may be a paragraph, and two prompts about the same thing begin
alike: what tells them apart is the rest of the text and when each was sent. An age is the one thing
about an old prompt everybody is sure of, and it is compact here rather than in the words the
session list uses, since it sits in a gutter beside every row rather than in a sentence.

Empty panels are the failure mode of every mode: nothing on screen and no word for it reads as an
interface that has stopped responding rather than as a search that is too narrow.

<a id="INPUT-21"></a>
### INPUT-21: Shift-Tab chooses how much the session asks before it acts

The key walks the modes in order and comes back round to the first, so no mode is one a person
cannot press their way out of. Which modes there are, and what each answers, is
[permission-modes.md](permission-modes.md); the mode in force is drawn on the hint line (INPUT-13).

Both spellings of the chord are answered. A terminal asked to disambiguate reports Shift-Tab as Tab
with a modifier, and one that has not sends the older `BackTab`, and which arrives is the terminal's
choice rather than the user's.

The key is read before Tab, so it never completes a half-typed line, and it types nothing: like `!`
and `?` it is a mode rather than a character. It works while a turn runs, which is when it is wanted
most, and the turn in flight keeps the mode it began with.

**Why.** A person watching a turn edit files it should not be editing is deciding about the next
turn, and this is how they say so without stopping the one in front of them. A binding answering one
spelling works on one machine and does nothing on the next, which reads as a broken key rather than
as a terminal difference.

Shift-Tab because it is the chord Claude Code uses for this, and somebody who has used one of these
reaches for it before reading anything.

<a id="INPUT-22"></a>
### INPUT-22: the context reading says which of three things the session knows

A session that has measured a request states how full the context is, as a percentage of the budget
the conversation is compacted at, capped at a hundred. A conversation shortened underneath that
figure says it was compacted, and how much room that won back, rather than how full the context
is, because the number it held describes an exchange that is not the one on screen. A session that
has measured nothing says that it has not measured anything.

**No state of the session is drawn as a blank.** A count that arrived with no budget to divide it
by states no percentage, and the session then knows no more about how full the context is than one
that has measured nothing, so it reads the same. A reading absent from the line is the width rule
of INPUT-13 dropping it whole, or the line belonging to the shell (INPUT-2), and neither is
something the session knows about the context.

**A compaction states how much room it won back, as a fraction of the budget it was compacted
at.** The summariser read the part of the exchange that stopped being sent and wrote what replaced
it, so the difference between those two counts is the room the conversation gave back. The figure
is marked approximate in every case, and it only ever over-states: the count of what the summariser
read holds the instructions it was given as well as the exchange, and nothing here can take them
off again. A compaction the server reported no usage for says that the conversation was compacted
and states no figure. A budget adopted after a compaction leaves the figure alone, since what was
won back is a fact about the exchange that was shortened rather than about the window in force
now.

**A percentage against a budget nobody advertised is marked as approximate.** The budget is a
window the endpoint reported for the model in force, a figure somebody set by hand, or a default
standing in for both. The default is a number chosen to be safe against models it knows nothing
about, so a reading against it is drawn with a mark saying it is one.

**A measurement is taken wherever one exists, not only where a turn ended well.** A session resumed
from disk opens with what the last request of the session it read came to. A turn in flight reports
what each round's request came to as the round completes, so the first turn of a session reads a
figure before it ends. A turn that failed after sending a request reports what that request came
to. A turn that sent nothing leaves the reading where it was, which for a session that has sent
nothing at all is absent.

**Why.** This reading is what a person uses to decide whether to compact, and it is the only
account of the size of a conversation that exists here: the server reports what a request cost and
never what it had room for, and there is no tokeniser to count with. Having just compacted is the
moment somebody most wants a figure and the one moment nothing has counted the conversation, since
the shortened one is not counted until the next request goes out; the compaction is itself a
request, so its own reply is where the figure comes from. A state drawn as a blank is
indistinguishable from the other state drawn as a blank, from a line too narrow to hold the figure,
and from a reading that has stopped working, so it makes the figure look intermittent, and a figure
that comes and goes is one people stop reading.

The mark on a guessed budget is the difference between two readings of a hundred per cent that ask
for opposite things. Against a window the endpoint stated, it means shorten the conversation.
Against the default, it may only mean the default is too small for the model in force, and the
answer is to set the budget rather than to compact.

### INPUT-23: the box edits the ordinary way or vi's, and only a person chooses which

The style is a preference about the person, so it outlives the session that chose it and applies in
every directory. A choice they made outranks a settings file, the file answers for somebody who has
never made one, and with neither the box is the ordinary one. The choice and the setting are both a
word, and a word naming no style is no choice at all whichever of the two spelled it: a settings file
that names none leaves the ordinary box, a record that names none leaves the file answering, and
neither stops anything from starting.

**A choice is made from a panel `/config` opens**, over the transcript, listing the styles with what
each one means and marking the one in force. Enter takes the row under the cursor and says so on the
transcript; Escape leaves the style alone. Whichever style is chosen, the box comes back taking
letters as letters, with no instruction left waiting for a key.

Vi editing has two modes over the same line. INSERT is the box everybody has, where a typed
character lands at the caret. NORMAL takes a letter as an instruction, and a letter it has no
instruction for does nothing at all rather than being typed. NORMAL opens two more for a while,
VISUAL ([INPUT-30](#INPUT-30)) and REPLACE ([INPUT-37](#INPUT-37)). Every session opens in INSERT.

A key beginning one of vi's instructions that this box does not have does nothing either, and nor
does the key vi would give it. `"`, `q`, `@`, `m`, `'`, `` ` ``, `z`, `Z`, `[` and `]` each take
one more key, and so do `g'` and `` g` ``. The operators vi spells after `g` that this box does not
have, which are `g?`, `gq`, `gw` and `g@`, take the stretch they would act on, the way `d` does.
After an operator, `'`, `` ` ``, `[`, `]` and `z` still take their key, so `d'a` does nothing. The
other prefixes end the operator there, as they do in vi, and the key after `dm` is read on its own.
VISUAL mode reads the prefixes the same way, except that the operators under `g` take no key, since
the selection is already the stretch they act on.

The ordinary box is in neither mode, and nothing about a mode is drawn at it.

**Why.** Somebody who edits text in vi reaches for `hjkl` before reading anything, and the cost of
the habit meeting a box without it is a prompt full of stray letters. It is a habit rather than a
property of a checkout, which is why the choice is the person's and why a file in a repository is
the weaker claim.

Opening in NORMAL is the one arrangement worth ruling out. The first sentence somebody typed would
go nowhere, and a box that swallows what is typed into it cannot be told apart from one that has
stopped working.

A letter with no instruction does nothing because the mode is not typing. Falling back to inserting
it would make NORMAL mode a place where half the alphabet quietly edits the prompt, and the person
would find out by reading the line rather than by pressing the key.

A prefix is the same promise one key later. `ma` is one instruction, and a box that did nothing with
the `m` alone would read the `a` as the next one and open INSERT mode. For the same reason `g?iw`
would type a `w`. Taking the key vi would give the prefix keeps the box doing nothing for the whole
of an instruction it does not have. Taking more than that is the opposite failure: after an operator
vi gives `m` no key, and a box that waited for one would swallow the instruction typed next.

### INPUT-24: Escape takes the letters as instructions, and takes nothing else

In vi's style Escape enters NORMAL mode and leaves the line exactly as it was. Ctrl-`[` is the same
request from a terminal that reports the modifier rather than sending the byte Escape already is,
and both are answered. Escape abandons an instruction still waiting for a key, so `d`, Escape, `w`
moves a word rather than deleting one. So does every other press that is not a character, such as
an arrow, Backspace or Enter, which then does what it does alone, and so does the press that stops a
turn. Pressed in NORMAL mode with nothing waiting, Escape is claimed and does nothing.

**While a turn runs, Escape is the box's until the box has no use for it:**

| The box | Escape |
|---|---|
| INSERT, VISUAL or REPLACE | enters NORMAL mode, and the turn keeps running |
| NORMAL, an instruction or a count waiting | abandons it, and the turn keeps running |
| NORMAL, nothing waiting | stops the turn ([INPUT-4](#INPUT-4)) |

Ctrl-`[` is Escape there too, and Ctrl-C stops the turn on the first press from every mode. A summary,
an aside, a goal check and a manifest run read Escape the same way, so it reaches them only from NORMAL mode with
nothing waiting. A command run from shell mode takes no press at the box, so Escape stops one from
every mode, and so does Ctrl-`[`. Discarding a half-typed line is still Ctrl-C. In the ordinary style
Escape discards the line as it always has and stops a turn on the first press (INPUT-4).

The mode the box is in is drawn beneath it, beside the mode that says what the session asks before
it acts, and is given up only after everything that is not a mode. The keys of an instruction still
waiting for more follow the mode word, as vi's `showcmd` draws them: `NORMAL d`, then `NORMAL di`,
and the word alone once the instruction is whole or abandoned.

**Why.** These are two presses of one key in the same box, and a key that both entered a mode and
threw a paragraph away would be one nobody could press safely. Somebody reaching for NORMAL mode
would lose a prompt each time, and the way to find out is to have already lost one.

A stopped turn costs more than a paragraph. A vi user presses Escape to leave INSERT out of habit,
and the box is still in INSERT once the prompt has gone, so a stop from there would end work nobody
asked to stop. Only in NORMAL mode with nothing waiting is the
press not one the box would take. Ctrl-C is the box's in no mode, so a turn going wrong can still be
stopped on the first press.

Answering one spelling of the chord works on one machine and does nothing on the next, which reads
as a broken key rather than as a terminal difference.

The mode earns its place beneath the box because it decides whether the next letter is a letter. A
person who cannot see that they are in NORMAL mode is looking at a box that has apparently stopped
taking what they type, and that is the same failure opening in NORMAL would cause.

An instruction still waiting decides what the next letter does as much as the mode does, so it is
drawn for the same reason and abandoned by the key a vi user presses to mean "not that". A `d` that
survived Escape would make the next motion a deletion, and one drawn nowhere would be found out that
way. Any other press that is not a character cannot be the key the instruction waits for, and a `d`
that survived an arrow would delete from wherever the arrow had put the caret. vi reads an arrow
after `d` as the motion it names; here the arrows belong to the line, so the arrow moves the caret
alone.

### INPUT-25: six keys open INSERT mode, each saying where the caret lands

`i` before the character the caret is on, `I` at the first character of the line, `a` after the
character the caret is on, `A` at the end of the line, `o` on a new line below, `O` on a new line
above. Opening a line leaves the caret on the new one.

Leaving INSERT mode puts the caret on a character rather than past the end of the line, since in
NORMAL mode the caret sits on the character the next instruction acts on.

`!` and `?` are instructions in NORMAL mode rather than the marks that arm shell mode and put the
key list up (INPUT-2, INPUT-13). Both are a press of `i` away.

**Why.** These are the keys somebody's hands already know, and the only thing that distinguishes
them is where the caret ends up, which is why they are one set rather than six unrelated bindings.

The caret cannot rest past the end of the line because there is no character there for an
instruction to act on, and a block drawn over the column after the line says the next press will
take something that is not there.

Reading `!` as the shell mark would arm a mode from a press asking for something else, and there is
no way out of a shell armed by accident except deleting back past the mark. The same press in
INSERT mode still arms it, which is where somebody who wanted a command is.

### INPUT-26: the motions move the caret and nothing else, and never rest inside a marker

| Keys | Where the caret goes |
|---|---|
| `h`, `l`, Space | one character left or right |
| `w`, `e`, `b`, `ge` | the start of the next word, the end of this word or the next, the start of this word or the previous, the end of the word before |
| `W`, `E`, `B`, `gE` | the same four, where a word is a run of anything that is not a blank |
| `0`, `$`, `^` | the first column, the last character, the first character that is not a blank |
| `_` | the first character that is not a blank, on the row the count names counting this one as the first |
| `\|` | the column the count names, counting the first as one |
| `gg`, `G` | the first character that is not a blank on the first line of the input, and on the last |
| `%` | the bracket that pairs with the first one at or after the caret on this line |
| `f`, `F`, `t`, `T` then a character | the next or previous occurrence of it on this line, landing on it or stopping one short |
| `;`, `,` | the last such jump again, and the same jump reversed |

To `w`, `e`, `b` and `ge` a word is a run of letters, digits and `_`, or a run of the other characters
that are not blanks, as it is to `iw` ([INPUT-29](#INPUT-29)): in `src/main.rs` each name is a word,
and so are the slash and the dot. A marker is a word by itself to these four, and to the capitals it
is part of the run it touches. In the first word there is no word before, and `ge` and `gE` go to the
start of the input. An empty row is a stop for `w`, `b` and `ge` and their capitals, and `e` and `E`
cross it.

The caret comes to rest on a character and never in the column after the line, since NORMAL mode's
caret sits on the character the next instruction acts on. A jump looks only along the line the caret
is on, and one that finds nothing leaves the caret where it was. Repeating with nothing to repeat
does nothing.

`%` pairs `(` with `)`, `[` with `]` and `{` with `}`, and counts only brackets of the kind it found,
so `(a]b)` pairs the round ones. It looks along the caret's line alone, and where the bracket it
found has no partner there, or the line has no bracket at or after the caret, it leaves the caret
where it was. `_` and `|` alone are `^` and `0`, and a column past the end of the line is its last
character.

A marker is crossed whole by every one of these, and there is no position inside one for a motion to
leave the caret at. A column that falls inside a marker is the marker, and `%` does not read the
brackets a marker is spelled with as brackets.

**Why.** These are the keys somebody's hands already know, so what they do here has to be what they
do everywhere else. `w` lands on the first character of the next word rather than after the word it
crossed, which is where the word keys under Ctrl land: both are wanted, and the letter has to mean
vi's. The word keys under Ctrl split on blanks alone, as every other line editor's do.

The word ends where vi ends one, and the motions read the classes of character `iw` and `iW` read, so
a motion and an object never disagree about where a word is. Split on blanks alone, `dw` on `src`
would take the whole path. The capitals are for crossing a path or a flag in one press. A marker is a
word by itself because it stands for one picture or paste, and the punctuation beside it is not part
of that. An empty row is a paragraph break, and a `db` that crossed it would take the end of the
paragraph above; `e` crossing it is vim's own exception, kept with the rest.

A jump crossing a newline would land off the row being read, which is not what a key for reaching a
bracket in front of you is for. Leaving the caret at the end of the line when the character is not
there would move it on a press that failed.

`gg` and `G` land on the first word rather than the first column because vi's do, and an indent is
not where anything a person reaches for begins. `_` and `|` are there for their count
([INPUT-35](#INPUT-35)): `^` and `0` name no row and no column, and `_` is how vi spells the doubled
letter for every operator at once ([INPUT-28](#INPUT-28)).

`%` is how somebody checks what a closing bracket closes without counting. It reads the caret's line
alone, as `i(` does ([INPUT-29](#INPUT-29)), so neither `d%` nor `di(` takes text off another row.
vi crosses lines, and the cost is a pair split over
rows, a block pasted in with its closing brace three rows down: `%` does nothing there, and the brace
is `j` and `f}` away. It skips a marker's brackets because they pair with each other, and landing on
the closing one would leave the caret inside a picture.

The marker rule holds because the motions walk through the same caret steps the arrows use, rather
than searching the line's bytes. A motion doing its own arithmetic would have to know the marker
rules itself, and the one that forgot would be the one that put the caret inside a picture: `f]`
names a character a marker is spelled with, and it did exactly that before it walked.

### INPUT-27: three of vi's letters are the keys they spell, wherever those keys reach

`k` and `j` are Up and Down: they walk the rows of a paragraph, then the prompt history, then the
transcript, exactly as the arrows do. `/` opens the search over the prompts already sent, which is
what Ctrl-R opens.

While a key is waiting for the one after it, every press is that key: `f/` jumps to a slash, `fj` to a
`j`, and after an operator `j` and `k` are the rows it takes (INPUT-28). A count in front of `k` or `j`
is the other exception, and it moves rows inside the input alone (INPUT-35).

**Why.** What these reach is not the line. Answering them by moving the caret would leave the prompt
somebody most wants unreachable from the mode they are in, and a person who pressed `k` on an empty
line would get nothing where the arrow beside it walks their history.

A counted one is the exception because a count says how far to go inside something, and the ladder
goes somewhere else at the end of it: `5k` on a two-row paragraph would replace the whole line with a
prompt from three back, and nothing on the screen would say what took the line away.

They are answered by translating the letter into the key it stands for, so there is one ladder rather
than two: a second copy would be a second set of conditions about when the history is reachable, and
the two would drift.

`/` opens that search because it is the only search here. A key that searched the line being typed
would be answering a question about a paragraph in a box ten rows tall, while the prompts a person
cannot see scroll away above it.

`d` takes a stretch out, `c` takes it out and opens INSERT mode where it was, `y` keeps it and leaves
the line alone, `>` and `<` move every row the stretch reaches a step from or towards the margin,
and `gu`, `gU` and `g~` make it lower case, upper case or the other case. Each waits for the stretch
to act on:

| Keys | The stretch |
|---|---|
| any other motion | from the caret to wherever that motion would take it |
| `j`, `k`, `G`, `gg`, `_` | every row from the caret's to the one the key reaches, whole |
| the operator's own letter doubled | the whole line: `dd`, and `guu` or `gugu` |
| `D`, `C`, `x`, `s` | to the end of the line, and the character under the caret |
| `X` | the character before the caret, taken out as `dh` would |
| `Y`, `S` | the whole line |

`~` changes the case of the character under the caret and moves the caret past it. `r`, or `gr` as
vim spells it too, makes that character the key typed next, whatever the key is, so `r3` puts a `3`
there. Counted, `r` changes that many characters, or none where the line holds fewer, and leaves the
caret on the last one it changed; `r` then Enter is the Enter alone ([INPUT-24](#INPUT-24)). The case
operators leave the caret where their stretch begins. A case change is one character for one, as vim
makes it. A letter is raised to Unicode's one-character capital, and one with none stays as it is,
except that `ß` raised is `SS`. A letter with a capital is lower case, so the title-case `ǅ` is raised
by `U` and `~` and left by `u`, and only other letters are lowered.

Only `d`, `c`, `y` and the keys spelled from them fill the register. A shift, a case change and `r`
leave it holding what it held.

Whether the character the motion landed on is taken depends on the motion: `de` takes the word's last
letter, `dw` stops before the next word's first. `ge` and `gE` take both ends, the character they land
on and the one the caret was on, so `dge` on the first letter of a word takes that letter and the last
of the word before. `%` takes both ends too, so `d%` takes both brackets and what lies between them
from either one, and `|` takes neither, so `d|` is `d0`. `cw` on a character that is not a blank
leaves the space after it, and on a blank takes it, and so does `cW`. On the last character of a word
`cw` changes that character alone. The last word a `w` or `W` counts under an operator ends at the
end of its line, so `dw` on the last word of a row leaves the newline, and on an empty row takes that
row.

After an operator `j` and `k` are the row below and the row above, and where there is no such row they
take nothing. The rows those five keys name are whole lines to every operator, as the doubled letter's
are: `dj` closes the gap and `cj` leaves one empty row to type on. An empty row is a row to every
operator that takes whole ones: `dd` and `dG` take it, `cc` opens INSERT on it, and `yy` puts it back
as an empty row. `>` leaves an empty row empty, as vi does.

`p` and `P` put the register back after and before the caret. A stretch that was whole lines comes
back as a line of its own. `J` makes this line and the one below into one with a single space where
the newline was, and `gJ` with nothing there and the blanks the line below began with left as they
were.

`u` puts back what the last change took, and pressed again the change before that, as far back as a
thousand changes; a count says how many. Everything typed in INSERT mode after `c` or a key that
opens it ([INPUT-25](#INPUT-25)) is one change with the key, so one `u` takes back `o`'s new row and
all that was typed on it, and a session that leaves the line as it was, an opening with nothing
typed or a `c` that typed back what it took, is no change. Nor is what is typed
in the INSERT mode a session and a newly chosen style begin in, before any key has opened it.
Sending, clearing or putting a line away leaves nothing to undo, and so does a line the box is
handed whole: recalled, chosen from the search, taken back from the queue, put back from the stash
or brought back from the editor ([INPUT-14](#INPUT-14)). Changing to the other style leaves nothing
to undo either ([INPUT-23](#INPUT-23)); choosing the style already chosen keeps what there was.

`.` does the last change again at the caret. After `c`, `s`, `S`, `C`, `i`, `a`, `I`, `A`, `o` and
`O` that is the key and what was typed after it, so `cwX`, Escape, `w`, `.` changes the next word to
`X` too; what is typed again is what the line was left holding, so a letter taken back with Backspace
is not in it. `p`, `P`, `J` and `gJ` are changes it makes again. It makes nothing again where what
it would type again holds a marker or an `@`, or was chosen from a list the box offered, or where
the line was edited somewhere other than where the typing went. Nor does it make again what `d` or
`c` did to a character-wise selection, what `r`, a case change, `J`, `gJ`, `p` or `P` did to any
selection, or what `R` typed over the line ([INPUT-37](#INPUT-37)). After one of those `.` does
nothing rather than make the change before it. What it makes again on a recalled prompt makes that
prompt the line being edited, as typing on it would ([INPUT-27](#INPUT-27)).

A marker is taken whole by every operator, or not at all, and taking one takes the attachment off.
A case change goes around a marker and leaves it as it was, and `r` over one does nothing.

**Why.** One operator over one set of extents is why `dw`, `cw` and `yw` are one idea rather than
three bindings, and why `d$` works without being listed: the letter says what happens and the rest
says where.

The row keys take whole rows because a row is what they count in, which is vi's rule. Read by the
character, `dG` would leave the last row standing with what was left of the caret's row joined onto
it, and `dj` from the middle of a row would split two rows apart. `j` and `k` are the history ladder
on their own (INPUT-27), and an operator waiting for its stretch claims them, since a stretch cannot
reach into a prompt that is not in the box. `_` takes rows because in vi it is the doubled letter for
every operator at once, so `d_` is `dd` and `d3_` is `3dd`.

The inclusive and exclusive motions are vi's distinction and not decoration, and `ge` is inclusive in
vim going back as well. `cw` behaving as `ce`, and `cW` as `cE`, is vi's own special case, kept
because the alternative is useless: a word replaced and run into the next one is never what somebody
meant, and typing the space back each time is what the key would cost. Run on from a word's last
character, it would take the next word too, and a slash in a path is such a word. A `dw` crossing the
newline after the last word would join the next row onto this one.
All of these were measured against vim rather than reasoned about, since they are facts about what
people's hands expect.

The register is vi's unnamed one and the only one. Named registers are a filing system, and a box
holding one line of thought has nothing to file. It is not the system clipboard, which Ctrl-V owns
and which a person shares with every other window they have open. Only what takes a stretch away or
copies it goes there, which is vi's rule: the others leave what they acted on in the line, and a
register they filled would lose the word somebody had yanked to put back.

`r` changes all the characters its count asks for or none, as vim does. A count the line cannot hold
is not one anybody meant, and replacing what there is would be a guess at what they did mean. One
character for one is vim's case rule too, and cutting a two-character case to its first would turn
`ß` into an `S` that had lost a letter.

`gJ` is for the line broken in the middle of a word or a path, where any space would be one the text
never had, and stripping the blanks after the break would take an indent somebody is keeping.

Undo goes as far back as vim's does by default because `.` is what makes changes cheap to pile up:
`x..` is three changes, and a person who finds the second was a mistake reaches for `u` twice. A
thousand steps are a thousand copies of a prompt, which is sentences rather than a file. The typing a
box begins with is the prompt being written rather than a change to it, and a `u` pressed once too
often would otherwise take the whole of it. The steps go when a line arrives whole because they are
copies of the line that was there, and `u` after a send would put back the prompt that had just
gone. The ordinary style keeps no steps, so a step kept across a change of style would put back a
line from before what was typed in it. There is no redo because its key, Ctrl-R, is the prompt
search in both styles ([INPUT-19](#INPUT-19)), so what `u` went past is typed again.

`.` does the instruction again rather than put back the line it produced, which is the whole point
of the key, and in vi what was typed after `c` or `i` is part of the instruction: `cw` then `X` is
"change the word to `X`", and repeating the `cw` alone would take the next word and put nothing in
its place. What is typed again is read off the line at Escape rather than recorded key by key, so a
session that moved off its own text and edited elsewhere is one that typing the same characters
again would not reproduce, and `.` makes nothing rather than something else. A marker or an `@` is
left out because typing it again would attach the same file or picture a second time, which nobody
who pressed `.` asked for, and a choice from a list is not typing.

A marker is one thing on the screen and one thing to the person looking at it, so half of one stands
for nothing and text that still reads as an attachment over something no longer attached is the
outcome to rule out. It holds because a stretch is measured between positions the caret could rest
at, and no such position is inside a marker. A case change goes around one because a marker is
found by its text: raised to `[IMAGE #1]` it names no picture, and the picture would be left off the
prompt while the line still read as though it carried one. `r` is refused over one for the reason a
selection holding one is ([INPUT-30](#INPUT-30)).

### INPUT-29: a text object is a stretch named by what it is

After an operator, `i` and `a` say the stretch is a thing rather than a distance, and the next press
says which thing: `w` a word, `W` a run of anything that is not a blank, and a quote or either half of
a bracket pair for what lies between them, with `b` for the round pair and `B` for the curly one. `i`
takes what is inside and `a` takes what surrounds it too. All on the line the caret is on.

A word object is the run the caret is in, and a run of blanks is a run, so the caret is always in
something. `aw` takes the blanks after the word, or the ones before it where there are none after. A
pair is the one enclosing the caret, or else the next one along the line. `a` over a quote pair takes
the blanks in front of it and over a bracket pair does not.

A key naming no kind of thing does nothing. A marker is taken whole or left alone, and to the word
objects it is what it is to the word motions ([INPUT-26](#INPUT-26)): a word by itself to `iw` and
`aw`, and part of the run it touches to `iW`.

**Why.** `ci(` is what somebody means when they want the arguments replaced, and the alternative is
counting characters to a closing bracket they can see perfectly well.

The pair being the next one along, and not only the enclosing one, is what makes `ci(` work with the
caret on the name in front of the bracket, which is where it usually is. `b` and `B` are vi's names
for the two pairs a block is written in, and somebody whose hands know `dib` has no reason to reach
for the bracket instead.

Three classes of character rather than two, because `w` treats punctuation as a word of its own: in
`src/main.rs` the slashes are part of neither name. `W` is the same machinery with punctuation folded
in, which is the whole of the difference between the two and the reason a path is one object.

The blank rules and the difference between a quote pair and a bracket pair were measured against vim
rather than reasoned about. They are facts about what people's hands expect, and the bracket case is
vim's own inconsistency: what a quote delimits reads as a word, so the blank beside it belongs to it,
where a bracket follows the name it belongs to.

The marker rule needs stating separately here because an object is found by reading the line, not by
walking the caret's own positions like every other stretch. A marker is spelled with brackets and a
digit, so `di[` named the brackets one is written with and left half of it standing for nothing.

<a id="INPUT-30"></a>
### INPUT-30: a stretch can be marked out first, and it is drawn while it is chosen

`v` marks out a stretch character-wise and `V` line-wise. Both ends cover the character they sit on, so
the stretch is never empty. Motions move the end the caret is at, `o` puts the caret at the other end,
and a text object becomes the selection.

An operator there needs no extent and acts on the selection: `x` is `d` and `s` is `c`, having nothing
left to distinguish. The capitals act on every row the selection crosses, whole, whichever kind it
is: `D` and `X` take the rows, `Y` keeps them, and `C`, `S` and `R` change them. `r` or `gr` replaces
every selected character with one, and `~`, `u` and `U` change the case, as do `g~`, `gu` and `gU`,
the selection being the stretch they would otherwise wait for. A case change there goes around a
marker as it does over a motion ([INPUT-28](#INPUT-28)). A line-wise selection goes into the register
as lines, and so do the rows a capital takes. `.` after `D`, `X`, `C`, `S` or `R`, or after `d`,
`c`, `>` or `<` over a line-wise selection, makes the change again to as many rows from the caret.

`p` puts the register where the selection is and leaves what the selection held in the register.
`P` does the same and leaves the register as it was. A count is how many copies. Rows stay rows:
over a line-wise selection the register replaces the rows, a copy to a row, and rows put over a
character-wise one split the line either side of it. The caret ends on the last character put. Where
the characters run over more than one row it ends on the first, and where rows went in, on the first
character of the first of them that is not a blank. A selection on the empty last row holds no
character, and the register goes there all the same and keeps what it held. With nothing yanked
neither key does anything, and the selection stays.

The key that opened the mode closes it, the other of the two changes which kind is in force, and
Escape abandons the selection. Every operator ends it, and so does an edit of the line it was marked
on, whether the edit came from one of vi's own keys or from a key VISUAL mode does not claim. A press
that deletes nothing has not edited the line and leaves the stretch standing; choosing a style of
editing abandons it along with the mode that showed it.

`gv` marks out again the last selection that ended, however it ended, of the same kind and with the
caret at the end it was at. Each end comes back at the row and the column it held before the key that
ended the selection acted, so after `V>` it is the same rows, now shifted. Where the line no longer
reaches that far an end stops where the line does, and one that falls inside a marker is the marker.
Pressed in VISUAL mode, `gv` trades the selection on the screen for the one before it, and a second
`gv` brings that one back. With no selection ended yet it does nothing, and a line that arrives
whole, sent, recalled or put away, is one on which none has ended.

**The whole marked stretch is drawn**, on every row it crosses, and the caret is not drawn within it.

A selection holding a marker is not replaced character by character: that press does nothing.

**Why.** Marking a stretch out and then saying what to do with it is the other way round from an
operator, and the reason to have both is that the stretch is on the screen while it is being chosen.
Which makes drawing it the whole point rather than a decoration: the next key acts on it, and a person
who cannot see which stretch is guessing. A caret drawn inside a reversed block says nothing, so the
selection takes its place.

`u` meaning lower-case here and undo without a selection is why each mode reads its own table. The
motions fall through to the other table rather than being restated, or a motion added to one would be
missing from the other.

The capitals take rows because that is what they do in vi, and what they mean without a selection,
the end of the line or the character before the caret, has no counterpart over a stretch already
marked out. `R` is among them for the same reason: replace mode over a selection has nothing to
replace that `c` would not. `.` counts rows because the selection is gone by the time it is pressed,
and a stretch nothing marks out any longer would leave the key doing nothing. vim repeats a change to
rows the same way.

`p` over a selection is how one stretch is swapped for another: `p` and then `p` again trades two, and
`P` puts one yank over several without the second press putting back what the first replaced. Rows
split the line for the reason a yanked row goes back as a row of its own ([INPUT-28](#INPUT-28)). vim
takes the selection out before finding nothing to put, which is a delete nobody asked for, so an empty
register leaves the selection standing instead. The empty last row is a place a person can put
something, as it is in vim, and the register keeps what it held because nothing was taken out to fill
it with. The caret is where vim leaves it in every case, measured rather than reasoned about.

Every operator ending the selection is what stops the next press acting on a stretch again for reasons
nothing on the screen explains. Escape abandoning it is the same rule from the other side.

A marker is not a run of characters to overwrite, and replacing the text either side while leaving it
standing would be a line nobody could read.

An edit ending the selection is what a stretch being a pair of positions costs: nothing about the two
says which line they were taken from, and the keys that edit are mostly not vi's own. Backspace, the
readline bindings, a paste, and the prompt an arrow recalls all reach the box while VISUAL mode is
open, and a selection they left standing would name characters that have moved or gone. Drawing that
is not a stretch drawn wrong but a line read outside itself, and the draw is on every frame. The
stretch is read off the line as it stands for the same reason, rather than trusted to be within it.

A press that deletes nothing is exempt because the stretch it would end is still exactly the one on
the screen, and a key that closed it would be doing something visible while doing nothing to the
line. The style of editing is the other way round: it is chosen away from the box, and the box it
comes back to may have no key that could act on a stretch and no mode to draw one for.

`gv` is for a selection an operator has just spent: shifting the same rows again, or changing a
stretch and then yanking it. Two positions would name other characters once the key that ended the
selection had moved any, so the ends are kept as rows and columns, which is what vim keeps too. They
are taken before that key acts because some keys move the caret as they end the selection, and `v1jU`
would otherwise come back as the one character the caret was left on. After `p` over a selection vim
marks out what was put; this box marks out the selection that was there, which is a known cost.

Block-wise selection is a known cost rather than a clause.

### INPUT-31: Ctrl-S on a prompt walked back to searches this workspace instead

While the box holds a prompt reached by walking back through the history, Ctrl-S opens the search over
the prompts sent, with the scope already narrowed to this workspace: the scope the search's own Ctrl-S
selects (INPUT-19). It is that search in every other respect, opened on the newest match with nothing
typed into it, closed the same way, and the wide list is one more press of the same key from inside it.
On any other line the key still puts the line away or brings one back (INPUT-17), and a line put away
earlier is still there afterwards. The border of the box names this chord beside Ctrl-R while an older
prompt is being walked back to, and gives the two up one at a time where the row will not hold them
beside which prompt is being shown: this one first, then the search over every prompt.

**Why.** Pressing Up says the wanted prompt is an old one, and of the old ones the prompts sent from
the workspace somebody is sitting in are the likelier answer. Up walks one prompt at a time, which is
no way to reach the hundredth, so a person who has pressed it several times is on a path with no end
and this is the key that takes them off it. The list it opens on has to be worth reading for any of
that to hold, which is what nothing being typed into it is for (INPUT-19).

The key means this here without being remembered, which is what makes it one key rather than two: the
line in the box is one the history put there rather than one the person typed, and the history holds it
already, so putting it away stores a second copy of something stored.

Which prompt is being shown is what only that row says, so it is what the row keeps, and the narrower
scope goes before the search it narrows because that search is the one also written down on the key
list. A title drawn anyway lands on top of the position and cuts it mid-word, which reads as a
rendering fault rather than as a border with no room for all of it.

### INPUT-40: Up walks this session's prompts, and the scope chord reaches every stored one

Up and Down walk the prompts this session sent, and the ones its record holds when it was resumed,
and Up stops at the oldest of them (INPUT-18). While a stored prompt is on screen, the scope chord,
Ctrl-N by default, walks every stored prompt from every session and workspace instead, staying on
the prompt on screen, and pressed again goes back to this session's. Where the prompt on screen is
not this session's, the way back lands on the newest of this session's before it, and failing that
the oldest of them. The border of the box names the scope with the position, `This session 2/3` or
`All 78/83`, and the chord that changes it. Ending the walk, editing the line, or sending puts the
scope back to this session's. `/clear` starts a new session's own prompts, and a prompt queued
during a turn counts as sent from the moment it is queued (INPUT-10). The stored file is unchanged:
which prompts are this session's is known from what this process sent and from the turns of a
resumed record.

A session that has sent nothing has nothing to recall, and Up says so on the hint line, naming the
scope chord; with an empty box that chord then widens the scope, and Up walks every stored prompt.
It does not walk into earlier sessions silently. Where the history has nothing to switch, in a line
being typed or with nothing recalled, the chord is not typed and does nothing, except that a
chord moved onto a line-editing key still edits there. Ctrl-Left, Ctrl-Right, Alt-Left and
Alt-Right are the caret's word motion everywhere, a recalled prompt included, since a prompt is
recalled in order to be edited and a terminal may deliver the arrows with a modifier as something
other than the key (macOS reserves Ctrl-Left and Ctrl-Right for Mission Control). The chord is
one of the ten a settings file can move (INPUT-32), and the border and the hint name the chord in
force. A person who moved it, or whose terminal delivers nothing for it, still reaches every stored
prompt through the search (INPUT-19).

`bravebot --incognito` stores nothing, so there are no earlier prompts there and the session scope
is all there is.

**Why.** A person who presses Up wants the last thing said in this conversation first. A walk
across every session mixes this conversation's prompts with other sessions' and gives no mark where
this one's end, so a person reaching for what they just said can land on a prompt from last week.
The wide list stays one chord away, and the search is where an old prompt is found by a word. The
switch is a letter chord because a letter chord reaches the app in every terminal, while a Ctrl
arrow chord may be taken by the system (Mission Control on macOS) and never arrive. It is one chord
that toggles because a pair of directions is two things to remember.

<a id="INPUT-32"></a>
### INPUT-32: a settings file can move ten chords, and nothing else

A `keybindings` block in `settings.json` names an action and the chord it is to answer, spelled
`ctrl-x`, `alt-o` or `ctrl+x`. It layers per action the way `env` does: a project file moving one
action's key says nothing about the other nine. There is no second file and no other spelling of the
block, so one place answers what a key does. Ten actions can be moved, and nothing else can:

- `background` (default: `ctrl-b`): move the command the turn is waiting on to the background
  ([RUN-25](tools/run.md#RUN-25)).
- `editor` (default: `ctrl-g`): open external editor for the current prompt.
- `watch` (default: `ctrl-l`): watch background delegate or inspect running actions.
- `scroller` (default: `ctrl-o`): open the transcript scroller.
- `history` (default: `ctrl-r`): open prompt history search.
- `stash` (default: `ctrl-s`): stash the current input line or bring it back.
- `trail` (default: `ctrl-t`): toggle turn execution trail visibility.
- `paste` (default: `ctrl-v`): paste from clipboard.
- `panel` (default: `ctrl-x`): show or hide the info panel ([PANEL-5](info-panel.md#PANEL-5)).
- `scope` (default: `ctrl-n`): switch the prompt history Up walks between this session's prompts and
  every stored one (INPUT-40).

**A chord has to carry Ctrl or Alt.** Every unmodified key is answered already: a character is
typed into the line, Enter sends, Escape clears it, Tab takes what is offered, and the arrows walk
the caret and the history. Shift over a character is refused as well, because a terminal reports
Shift-A as `A` with Shift held, so a chord written `shift-a` or `ctrl-shift-a` names an event that
never arrives. Four chords are refused while carrying Ctrl: Ctrl-C, which stops and then leaves,
and Ctrl-D, which leaves (INPUT-4), and Ctrl-J and Shift-Enter, which start a line (INPUT-2).

**Why.** The arms that read a configured chord sit above the arm that types, so a letter handed to
an action is a letter that can no longer be written: a settings file could take `x` out of the
alphabet. Refusing the whole unmodified half of the keyboard is one rule a person can hold rather
than a list of the keys that happen to be taken today, and the keys the issue is about, Ctrl-S and
Ctrl-O, are reachable under it.

**Every action is left on a key of its own.** A chord the parser cannot read, or one the box
already answers, leaves that action on its default. So does a chord two actions would both answer,
and both of them give it up rather than one keeping it. Two actions trading chords is not a conflict
and both take what they asked for, since a chord is contested only where some other action still
stands on it once every request has been read.

**Why.** Two actions on one chord is worse than either falling back: the routing reads one of them
first, so the other cannot be reached at all, and the list `?` puts up names the same chord twice
while one of the two lines is a lie. Which action wins would come down to the order the code reads
them in, which is nothing a person could predict from what they wrote, so neither wins.

**A mode reads the chord that opened it.** Inside the search over prompts, the chord that puts a line
away narrows the scope and the one that opened the search closes it (INPUT-19, INPUT-31); inside the
view of what a delegate is doing, the chord that opened the view leaves it. Ctrl-C keeps its own
meaning in both, and the chord an action was moved off of does nothing. In the view so does every
other key held with a modifier but Shift, the chord an action was moved onto among them, save the
scroller's Ctrl-U, Ctrl-D and Ctrl-B ([SCROLL-3](scroller.md#SCROLL-3)), which the view borrows.
The move key at its default is therefore a page back in the view and in the scroller, and moves a
command only from the box.

**Why.** Every character narrows the prompt search and bare letters walk the delegate list, so a
chord these modes did not ask the bindings about is not merely unanswered: it is read as the letter
it carries, and the search a person moved a chord to open narrows itself to prompts holding an `s`.
Shift is spared because Shift-Tab arrives carrying it.

**A configured chord takes precedence over line editing.** When a chord is moved onto one of the
readline editing keys (such as `ctrl-u` or `alt-b`), the action answers rather than the line
editing arm. In vi's normal mode, `/` translates to the chord configured for history search.

**The screen names the chord that answers.** `?` lists the keys from the one place they are written
down (INPUT-13), and the ten rows above are asked of the chord in force rather than spelled out
there. So is every other line that names one: the row saying what brings a stashed line back
(INPUT-17), the border while an older prompt is being walked back to (INPUT-31), the keys under the
search (INPUT-19), the hint saying there is something to watch, the note left where a picture on the
clipboard needs a key of its own, and the scroller's way out
([SCROLL-7](scroller.md#SCROLL-7)). A translated line names the chord by taking it as an argument, so
no catalog has to be revisited when a default moves. Where a clause of this spec or another names one
of the ten, it names the default.

**Why.** A list is worth having only where it is right, and a person reads it at the moment a key
they pressed did nothing. Keeping a second copy for the defaults is the same list twice: the copy
`?` was drawn from had already stopped saying that Ctrl-S searches as well (INPUT-31), and nothing
on the screen would have shown it. The scroller's way out named Ctrl-C in the keys and again in the
meaning beside them, which reads as two different presses. A sentence with the chord written into it
is worse than either, because the words around it are the reason somebody believes it.

### INPUT-33: a session takes the terminal for its length, and gives every part of it back

Starting a session in the interface that draws puts the terminal in raw mode and moves it to a
screen of its own, so what was in the terminal beforehand is untouched and is back on the screen
afterwards. A session in lines ([cli.md](cli.md)) takes none of what follows, and this
clause is about the one that draws. With that screen the
session asks for mouse reporting, narrowed to the buttons, the wheel and motion while a button is
held; bracketed paste; focus reporting; and, only where the terminal says it understands the
request, disambiguated keys.

Every one of those is given back when the session ends, including when it ends by failing rather
than by being left, and again around each handover of the terminal to another program: the editor
a prompt is written in and the viewer a transcript is read in both get the terminal as it was
found, and the same set is taken again on the way back.

**Why.** Each mode is asked for because something here cannot work without it. The wheel scrolls
the transcript only while the mouse is reported, and all-motion reporting is narrowed away because
a pointer merely crossing the window is an event and a redraw per pixel of travel, for a gesture
nothing here reads. Bracketed paste is what stops a pasted prompt sending itself, since without it
the newline most clipboards carry arrives as Enter; it is also the only thing that says a paste came
off a clipboard at all, so where a terminal does not send those markers a paste arrives as bare keys
and nothing downstream can tell it from what a program wrote. Focus reporting is what makes the
clipboard
worth a look at the one moment a picture appears on it, rather than polled for ever. Disambiguated
keys are what make Shift-Enter arrive at all, a terminal otherwise sending the same byte however
Enter was pressed.

Giving them back is owed because none of them is this program's to keep. A mode left on outlives
the process: mouse reporting turns a later click into unreadable bytes, bracketed paste prints its
markers into whatever is typed next, and a keyboard enhancement pushed and never popped sits on a
stack the terminal keeps for every program after this one. The failing exit is the case that
matters most, since a terminal left in raw mode on a screen that is not its own is worse for the
person than whatever error put it there.

### INPUT-34: what arrived together is not two presses

A terminal delivers one byte stream and says nothing about who wrote it, so a person at a keyboard and
a program holding the other end of the pty arrive identically and no reader can ask which it has.
**Nothing here tries.** Every event is delivered exactly as the terminal reported it, and what is added
is one fact beside each: whether it was the whole of what was waiting, or arrived together with others.

One event waiting is what a person pressing a key looks like, since nothing fills the buffer between
one read and the next. Two or more were available at the same instant, so **no one of them is evidence
separate from the rest**, whatever they are: a key beside a resize is no more a separate press than two
keys are.

**A key release is the tail of a press and not a second arrival.** A terminal may report one, and
Windows reports one for every keystroke, so there a press and the release of the same key land in one
read whenever the interface was busy longer than somebody held the key down. Counted, that would make
one keystroke look like two on a whole platform, and every guard below would refuse a press nobody
shared with anything. A release is still delivered exactly as the terminal reported it, since nothing
here withholds; it is only not counted, which it can afford to be because nothing answers one.

**What asks for it is anything that decides, and nothing else.** The rung that ends a session
([INPUT-4](#INPUT-4)), the question a session opens with ([PROMPT-7](prompting.md#PROMPT-7)), and the
return that takes the line out of the box. Each of those grants or spends something a person cannot get
back, and a program able to write bytes at the terminal writes the key that does it: an editor typing a
virtualenv activation ends its line with a return, and taking that return sent a line nobody wrote to
the planner. Every other reader answers the event it was given, exactly as before this existed, because
moving the caret or narrowing a list costs nothing if a program does it.

**The line stays where it is when the return is refused**, and the refusal is said. Words that vanish
leave somebody with no account of what happened, and a key that does nothing without a word reads as an
interface that has stopped answering. So the text can be read and then sent deliberately or cleared,
which is also why a program cannot make it look touched: an arrow and a return in one write are two
keys that arrived with each other, so neither is a press.

**Why it is one reader.** What arrived together can only be seen where the whole of it is visible. A
prompt reading the terminal itself takes the first key of a burst with nothing behind it and believes
it arrived alone, which is the fact this exists to get right, so every reader in the interface goes
through this one rather than calling the terminal.

**What this deliberately does not do.** It does not decide that a person's keystrokes were a program's.
A reader doing that is wrong about a fast typist behind a slow redraw, about tmux and about ssh, since
what lands in one read is decided by everything between the keyboard and this program rather than by
how fast anybody typed; and being wrong that way costs somebody their own line. Nothing is withheld,
reclassified or delayed. **So this does not stop a program that writes at the terminal from answering a
question**, and nothing here should be read as claiming it does: a question answered by a bare letter
is answered by a bare letter whoever wrote it. What it buys is the one distinction a terminal leaves
available, spent in the one place where a second press is the whole of what is being asked for.

### INPUT-35: a count in front of an instruction says how many

`1` to `9` begin a count and every digit after one continues it, so `0` is still the key for the
first column and is a digit only once a count has begun: `10l` is ten characters and `0` alone is
column one. A count in front of an operator and a count in front of its motion multiply, so `2d3w`
is `d6w`.

| What it counts | Keys |
|---|---|
| how many times over the motion is meant | every motion of [INPUT-26](#INPUT-26) but `%` and the ones below, and `;` and `,` |
| which row to go to | `G` and `gg`, and `_`, counting the caret's row as the first |
| which column to go to | `\|` |
| how many rows to move inside the input | `j` and `k`, which reach no history counted ([INPUT-27](#INPUT-27)) |
| how much of the extent the operator takes | `3dd`, `d3w`, `3x`, `3X`, `3~`, `3rx`, `3gUU`, `3>>` |
| how many copies, and how many rows end as one | `p`, `P`, `J` and `gJ`, where `3J` is three rows and `2J` is the bare key |
| how many the repeat is of, in place of the count recorded | `.` |
| how many changes back | `u` |

A counted motion moves the end of a selection as far as it moves a bare caret, so `v2j` marks three
rows out. A count in front of `%` is spent and the caret stays where it was, and so does the line
under `d2%`. The extents that name no quantity take no count, since there is no second end of the line
to reach, no second thing the keys named and no second selection: `3D`, `d3iw`, and a counted
operator or capital in VISUAL mode act on what the uncounted one would. The keys that open INSERT
mode take no count, and nor does `.` making one of them again: `3ix` and Escape types one `x`.

**The line bounds a count, and not the number typed.** Every counted motion stops at the first step
that moves nothing, so `999l` costs the length of a line, and an extent takes what there is, so
`9dd` on a two-row paragraph takes the two rows. `r` takes all of its count or nothing, so `5rx`
with two characters left changes neither ([INPUT-28](#INPUT-28)). `p` is the one that can ask for
more than the line holds, since a copy always goes somewhere: what bounds it is the cap the digits
are read up to, and nothing else. A digit typed past the cap leaves the count there.

**A counted change is one change and one step to undo.** A count is spent by the instruction it was
typed in front of, including one that means nothing, and it is abandoned by everything that abandons
an instruction still waiting for a key ([INPUT-24](#INPUT-24)). It is drawn beside the mode word
with the rest of that instruction, so three presses are `NORMAL 2d3`.

A digit a key is already waiting for is that key rather than a count: `f3` jumps to a `3`, and a
prefix with no instruction here swallows one the way it swallows a letter ([INPUT-23](#INPUT-23)).

**Why.** A count is how a vi user says how far, and it is the half of the grammar that makes the
motions worth having: `3j` and `d2w` are two of the first things such a person types. Without one
the digits were keys that did nothing, which reads as a box that has stopped answering.

Bounding by the line rather than by the number is what keeps that safe. A count is read before the
instruction it belongs to is known, so somebody leaning on a digit spells a number nothing on the
line can reach, and a box that walked it out one position at a time would stop answering for as long
as it took.

One change and one undo step is the rule an instruction already keeps ([INPUT-28](#INPUT-28)), read
against one the count made bigger. Carried out as one change per step, `3x` would take three presses
of `u` to put back what one instruction took.

A count in front of an opening key is spent because what vim does with it, type the text that many
times over, is a way of filling a file with rows, and a prompt that wants one word three times is
typed faster than it is counted.

`%` takes no count because in vi a count makes it a different key, the row that many hundredths of
the way through the file, and a prompt's handful of rows is what `G` already names. Read as more of
the same, `3%` would bounce between the two brackets and land on whichever the number happened to be
odd or even for.

The count is drawn for the reason a half-typed instruction is: it decides what the next letter does,
and a person who typed one by accident would otherwise find out from what the next letter did.

### INPUT-36: Ctrl-Enter stops the turn and sends what is waiting, as one turn

Ctrl-Enter mid-turn takes the line out of the box exactly as Enter does ([INPUT-10](#INPUT-10)), and
then stops the turn in flight as Ctrl-C does ([INPUT-4](#INPUT-4)). What was waiting when it was
pressed goes once the turn has ended, and the prompts among it go as **one** turn, one to a line, in
the order they were typed. Over an empty box it does the second half alone.

**A turn of its own, with what a turn gets.** Routing is precommitted from all of them together, and
every file and picture each of them named goes with it, because this is a turn beginning rather than
words handed to one already running (INPUT-10). It sends what Up, Escape and Enter would have sent
([INPUT-18](#INPUT-18)), without the box in between. Nothing reaches the planner twice: none of them
is left where the turn it begins could take it again as an interjection.

**Only as far as the first line that is not a prompt.** A command or a command line waiting among
them keeps its place. The prompts ahead of it go together, it is carried out, and the prompts behind
it go together after it, so what was typed first still happens first. A command with no prompt ahead
of it is carried out as soon as the turn has stopped, which is reason enough to press the key.

**Only what was waiting when it was pressed.** A prompt queued afterwards, while the turn was still
stopping, was queued with Enter and waits for a turn of its own.

**Only a turn is stopped.** A compaction, a question asked aside, a goal check and a manifest run are
not turns, so there the key queues the line as Enter does and stops nothing, and Escape is still the
key that stops one. With nothing waiting and nothing typed it stops nothing either, since there would
be nothing to send. Otherwise the stop is a stop like any other: a running loop
ends with it ([LOOP-11](loop.md#LOOP-11)), and a hurried turn that is itself stopped comes back to the
box whole, every prompt in it leaving the history as a single stopped prompt does.

**The offer is drawn beside the last waiting row.** While a turn runs with something waiting, and
only where the chord can arrive ([INPUT-5](#INPUT-5)), the mark under the last queued line says
`ctrl-enter to stop the turn and send now`. Not once a stop has been asked for, since the turn is
already stopping and what waits goes when it has. One offer for the whole queue, since the key sends
the whole queue, and dropped whole where the width will not hold it. The key list names it too
([INPUT-13](#INPUT-13)).

**Why.** A queued prompt waits for the answer being written, which is right while the person wants
that answer (INPUT-10). Once they have seen enough, having the queue go now took three keys and the
knowledge that Up takes the queue back. A stop that sent the prompts one at a time would begin a turn
for the first that the second was written to correct, so they go as one, which is what the person
would have typed had they known in advance.

### INPUT-37: `R` types over the line, and Backspace puts back what it took

`R` in NORMAL mode opens REPLACE mode, and the hint line says `REPLACE`. Each character typed there
takes the place of the one under the caret, and the caret moves past it; a letter is a letter, as it
is in INSERT. Where there is no one character to take the place of, the character goes in beside the
caret instead: at the end of a row, which it lengthens rather than eating the newline, and on a
marker, which stays whole ([INPUT-3](#INPUT-3)). A new line ([INPUT-2](#INPUT-2)) goes in beside as
well, breaking the row and taking nothing, and Enter sends as it does from INSERT.

Backspace takes back the last character typed and puts back the one it took the place of, as far back
as where `R` was pressed. Once the caret has moved off the end of what was typed, Backspace steps the
caret left and takes nothing. Ctrl-W and Ctrl-U are Backspace as far as the start of the word and of
the row. Escape goes back to NORMAL mode, while a turn runs as well ([INPUT-24](#INPUT-24)).

Everything typed between `R` and Escape is one change, and `u` puts the line back as it stood before
the first character. An `R` left with nothing typed is no change, so `u` after it still takes back the
change before. Any other edit of the line, such as a paste, Delete, or a line sent or recalled, ends
the change, and what is typed over after it is a change of its own that Backspace takes back alone.
`.` repeats none of it and does nothing after it ([INPUT-28](#INPUT-28)). A count in front of `R` is
spent and says nothing.

**Why.** `R` is how vi fixes a stretch of the same length without counting it out first, and in a box
that had no instruction for it the letters after it were read as instructions. Backspace taking back
only what was typed is vi's rule, and the reason for it: the mode is for typing over a line, and a key
that went on to eat the line the person came to would be INSERT's Backspace under another name. Ctrl-W
and Ctrl-U follow it for that reason, as they do in vim. A marker is typed beside rather than over
because a marker with its first bracket gone names no attachment.

The change begins at the first character rather than at `R` because an `R` pressed and left would
otherwise be a change that changed nothing, and the next `u` would put back nothing. Another edit ends
it because the change is kept as the line it began on, and REPLACE mode outlives a prompt being sent:
typing on after one, `u` would put back what had already gone. vim repeats the
typing with `.` and types it over as many times as a count says. Neither is here, since what REPLACE
mode typed is not an instruction the session keeps; both are known costs.

### INPUT-39: a line cleared with Escape or Ctrl-C comes back with Up

A line with something in it that Escape clears in the ordinary box, or that the first Ctrl-C rung
takes ([INPUT-4](#INPUT-4)), is kept as a draft. Up brings it back ahead of the newest sent prompt:
the first press puts it in the box with the caret at its end and sends nothing, and further presses
walk the sent prompts as before ([INPUT-18](#INPUT-18)). Down walks forward through it to the line
that was being typed. This holds when no prompt has been sent yet.

There is one draft. The next line cleared replaces it, and sending any prompt drops it. Bringing it
back does not remove it, so Up finds it again until one of those happens. A blank line is not kept.
A prompt walked back to is not kept either, since the history holds it already, and clearing it
leaves the draft as it was.

**The draft is the person's own typing, and not a sent prompt.** It is kept for the session only. It
is not written to the stored history, is not offered by the search ([INPUT-19](#INPUT-19)), is not
counted in the position the border of the box names ([SESSION-6](sessions.md#SESSION-6) is where
sent prompts are kept). With it in the box, Ctrl-S puts it away like any typed line,
where on a sent prompt it opens the search ([INPUT-31](#INPUT-31)). The words travel and the mode
does not, as for the stash ([INPUT-17](#INPUT-17)): a command cleared in the armed shell comes back
as words. A marker in it names what it named while that is still staged, and clearing leaves what is
staged where it was.

**Why.** Escape and Ctrl-C clear in one press, so one slip lost a paragraph with nothing to get it
back from. Claude Code keeps a cleared draft in the history for Up, after a second Escape. The single
press stays here, and recovery costs no press on the clear itself. Dropping the draft on a send is
what keeps it from outliving the thought it belonged to. The stash is a separate slot because it is
a line put away on purpose ([INPUT-17](#INPUT-17)).

### INPUT-41: a change in the terminal's size is drawn without waiting for another event

While the box is idle, a change in the terminal's size draws a frame at the new size. The frame is
the one a terminal of that size would have drawn from the start, so the hint row and the status row
sit on the new bottom row, fitted to the new width. A burst of size changes from dragging a window
edge is coalesced into frames like any other burst of input, not drawn once per event.

**Why.** Without a frame on a size change, the idle loop draws nothing until a key arrives, so the
screen keeps the old size's layout, and the bottom row suffers most. Every other loop draws on each
pass, so only the idle loop needs this event.
