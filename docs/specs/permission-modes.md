## Scope

A standing answer to the questions a person is otherwise asked one at a time. Four modes: asking,
accepting edits, planning, and bypassing every check. One key cycles them, and `/plan` sets planning. The mode in force is
drawn under the input box for as long as it holds.

What each of those questions *is*, and what a prompt owes its reader, is
[prompting.md](prompting.md). This spec covers only who answers them and what an answer amounts to
when nobody is asked.

A mode is not a rule. Rules written in advance in the settings file are
[permissions.md](permissions.md), they decide whether there is anything to prompt about, and a mode
answers a prompt that a rule has already permitted to exist. The two meet in MODE-6.

## What a mode decides

<a id="MODE-1"></a>
### MODE-1: asking is the mode a session opens in, and the only one that puts every effect to a person

A session with nothing chosen asks about a write, a run, a command's output, and a file nobody
vouched for, exactly as one does where no mode can be chosen at all. A one-shot run is in this mode
unless the flag in MODE-5 was given.

Asking is what the mode does, and not a promise that every one of those questions is reached. The run
question is not put again where the person answered it earlier in the session, where a rule they wrote
in advance covers the line ([permissions.md](permissions.md)), or where the audited table proves it
([tools/command-line.md](tools/command-line.md)); the record [tools/run.md](tools/run.md) specifies
is a fourth such road and one a one-shot run does not read. None of them is a mode, and choosing this
one takes nothing back.

**Why.** The mode nobody selected cannot be one that stops asking. Every other mode here is a
decision somebody made; this one is what holds when they have made none.

<a id="MODE-2"></a>
### MODE-2: accepting edits answers the write prompt and no other, except where the write would create a credential

A write goes through unasked. A run, a command's output and a file nobody vouched for are still put
to the person.

A write the credential scan found a value in that a person decides about
([CRED-16](credential-protection.md#CRED-16)) is put to the person as well. The mode is not the
person, and the approval is for the exact bytes they were shown. Where nobody is there to be shown
them, the write is refused and the planner is told nothing was created
([CRED-13](credential-protection.md#CRED-13)). The person may answer for the file for the rest of
the session or past it, and the credential spec says how far each answer reaches. What decides this is the
finding the policy layer produced, never the body of the write.

**Why.** A write and a run are not the same risk. A write lands in a tree the person can read
afterwards, and `git diff` shows them all of it; a program runs with everything their own shell has,
leaves no diff, and its output is what the next stage reads. A mode named for edits that also
stopped asking about programs would be granting the larger thing quietly.

A credential is the exception on the write side. The diff shows the person the value, and by then it
is in the tree, which is the one place [credential-protection.md](credential-protection.md#CRED-13)
says it must not reach unasked. The question has to come before the write, and a mode chosen to
stop reviewing diffs one at a time is not somebody saying they will not look at a secret, so the
mode cannot be what answers it. Bypassing is that statement (MODE-4).

<a id="MODE-3"></a>
### MODE-3: plan mode refuses a write rather than asking about one

The refusal does not depend on how the person would have answered, nor on whether they would have
been asked at all: writing is refused where the prompt would have been approved, and equally where
a path the trust map already covers, or a path a rule in the settings file allows, would have
raised no prompt. Commands, output and vouching are put to the person as they are in every other
mode, and what a command does once it is approved is bounded by that prompt rather than by this
clause.

A manifest run the session starts ([manifest.md](manifest.md#MANIFEST-11)) is refused from its
frozen plan, before the plan is put to the person, where any step in it writes a file. The plan is
where the mode has to be answered for the same reason the prompt is not: a body the plan carried,
going to a path the person vouched for, raises no write prompt at all, so a refusal that waited for
one would let the whole run through. A plan that writes nothing runs, since there is nothing in it
for this clause to refuse.

The planner is told, in the system prompt, that writing is refused for the turn and why.

**Why.** A mode whose only difference was that somebody keeps saying no is a session where the
planner proposes writes and reads back refusals it cannot account for, and a planner that cannot
tell a policy from a mistake retries. Stating it once is what turns a series of refusals into a
constraint the planner can work inside.

A refusal that waited for the prompt would be no refusal in the sessions most likely to be in this
mode. Somebody planning work in a tree they vouched for at startup is exactly the person whose
writes raise no prompt, so the mode has to hold where the prompt is absent or it holds where it is
least needed.

Commands keep their prompt because research is most of what planning is. `git log`, a search and a
test run are how a plan is arrived at, and a mode that could not read the tree would produce plans
made from less than the person can see themselves.

<a id="MODE-4"></a>
### MODE-4: bypassing answers every permission question, including the ones that decide trust

A write, a run, a command's output and vouching for a file nobody vouched for are all approved
without being put to anybody, and the question a session opens with about trusting the working
directory is not put either: the workspace is trusted, which is what answering it yes would have
recorded ([trust-map.md](trust-map.md) is what that record means). A directory a settings file
asked for is opened and vouched for without being put either, and so is a directory a
`request_path` is granted for, which is opened for the file tools as `/add-dir` would open it
([PATHREQ-7](tools/request-path.md#PATHREQ-7)). So are the three questions about a
server a checkout asks for: whether to start it, whether to offer its list of tools, and whether to
make a call to one of them ([SERVERS-13](mcp-servers.md#SERVERS-13)). Whether a remote server moved
where its reply pointed is not answered: a yes would rewrite the person's declaration to a url the
server wrote, so the hop is refused unasked ([SERVERS-11](mcp-servers.md#SERVERS-11)).

**A program's write is answered in advance.** Under the sandbox mode `standard` on macOS and Linux,
the stages of the lead session's `run` are given at the start every path a `request_path` for
writing would be granted ([SANDBOX-28](sandboxing.md#SANDBOX-28)), so a run does not fail on a
sibling directory before the planner can ask. The refusals of that request hold: the home directory
and the directories above it as wholes, `~/.ssh`, `~/.bravebot`, the credential locations and the
person's `denyRead` and `denyWrite`. This widens `standard`'s writes, which is the one way the
permission mode widens a sandbox mode ([SANDBOX-22](sandboxing.md#SANDBOX-22)). The mode never
changes which sandbox mode is in force, so `strict` keeps the per-path request, and bypass does not
approve a line that asks to start with no profile ([SANDBOX-29](sandboxing.md#SANDBOX-29)). A
delegate's programs are not given it.

**A write that would create a credential is answered too.** A value the credential scan inferred is
a question for the person under MODE-2, and here the flag is the person's answer to it, as it is to
every other question the scan raises: the write lands, with nobody asked and in an unattended run as
in the terminal ([CRED-13](credential-protection.md#CRED-13)). The yes writes nothing down, so
neither of the longer answers a person is offered is recorded by the mode. A value that declared
itself is refused before the mode is reached, here as everywhere.

The two prompts that promote one slot's bytes are answered yes unless the run also asked for
auto-vetting ([CHECK-11](vetting.md#CHECK-11)). Where it did, the check's word is what answers in the
absent person's place, and a word that is not `safe` refuses: the alternative is promoting content a
check objected to, which is the one thing the screening was asked for to stop. Refusing is the answer
a check that did not complete gets as well as one that objected, because content has some influence
over the call that reads it and an answer that promoted on a failure is an answer an attacker can
reach. The planner is told the bytes were kept back and is told nothing about what decided that, as
[CHECK-9](vetting.md#CHECK-9) requires of every route.

**A release this mode made is recorded as this mode's.** The two promotions are the only answers
here that are written into the audit trail as somebody's word about bytes, and where nothing
screened them there is no such word: nobody was shown the bytes and no check was made about them.
So the trail names the mode rather than a person or a check
([CHECK-8](vetting.md#CHECK-8), [OUTPUT-1](tools/read-output.md#OUTPUT-1)). Where screening was
asked for, the check's word is what answered, and the trail names that instead. What the mode
authorises is the promotion; what this decides is what the record of it says.

Vouching is not one of those two. It writes a standing rule about a path rather than promoting one
read, which is a larger question than the one a check answered, so it is approved here however a
check about today's contents came out.

The two about trust are the ones that cost the most. Vouching is what lets a file's contents be
shown to the planner rather than held behind a reference, so in this mode every file the planner
asks to read is shown to it, and the startup question grants that over the whole tree at once
rather than a file at a time. A command's output still goes behind a reference, since a run approved
here vouches for nothing, and where no screening was asked for a run that asks with `read` has it
released in its own result ([RUN-22](tools/run.md#RUN-22)).

A run approved this way vouches for no program. The list of commands a person said to stop asking
about is written into the session record and outlives the mode, and a record claiming somebody
approved programs they were never shown would be a standing permission nobody granted. The same
holds of a server: a start, a list and a call approved this way write nothing to `mcp-approved`,
`mcp-projects` or `mcp-tools`, and a call is approved once rather than for the rest of the session.

**No check is made where nothing would read its word.** [CHECK-10](vetting.md#CHECK-10) puts a
confined check in front of every prompt that would promote quarantined content, and this is the one
mode where those prompts are answered without being shown to anybody. Where the run asked for no
screening, a check would be a model call whose word nobody reads, so it is not made and the verdict
filled in is the one that claims nothing. Where it asked for screening, the word is read on the two
promotion prompts, so the check is made there; the vouch offer and a server's list read no word in
this mode whatever was asked for, so no check is made before either. This is the only exemption
from that clause.

**Why.** The mode is for a place where the blast radius is bounded by something other than these
prompts, which in practice means a container with no network and nothing in it worth losing. It is
the wrong mode everywhere else, and it is named `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for that reason.

## Choosing one

<a id="MODE-5"></a>
### MODE-5: bypassing is one rung of the ladder the key walks, and a flag opens the session on it, unless a layer made it unreachable

The key walks asking, accepting edits, planning and bypassing, in that order, and back to asking,
in every session. `--dangerously-skip-permissions` does not put the mode on the ladder; it opens the
session in it. Without the flag a session opens asking and reaches bypass by pressing the key three
times. Nothing is asked when it gets there: the line under the input box draws the mode in colour
([INPUT-13](terminal-input.md#INPUT-13)), and that is the only notice.

The flag is taken out of the arguments before anything dispatches on it, so it composes with a
bare invocation, `-p`, `--resume`, `--continue`, `--mode` and `--incognito` alike, and repeating it
asks for the same thing once. A one-shot run has no key to press, so the flag is the whole of what
can say.

**Unless a layer made the mode unreachable.** Where a settings layer in force wrote
`permissions.bypassUnreachable` ([PERM-17](permissions.md#PERM-17)), the mode is not on the ladder and
the key cannot reach it however many times it is pressed. The flag is **refused**: the run stops
before it dispatches, and what it says names `permissions.bypassUnreachable` and the file that asked
for it, so that a flag which is documented and works elsewhere is not left looking like a fault in the
program. Nothing is downgraded to asking, because a run told to stop asking and carried on with a
notice is a run whose author believes it is unattended.

The layers are read again where the session moves to another directory with `/cd` or reads its rules
again with `/clear`. If one of them now wrote the key, the mode comes off the ladder and a session in
it goes back to asking, with a line in the transcript saying why. The ladder does not regain the mode
when a later directory wrote nothing: a restriction a session could lift by moving is not one.

Where the flag was given, moving the key off bypass does not leave the screen blank. The line under
the input box and `/status` name asking, which they do for no session started without the flag: there
asking is what has always happened, and here it is the answer to whether the session stopped skipping
permissions. A session that reached bypass with the key draws nothing when it leaves, as it drew
nothing before it entered. Leaving the mode prints nothing in the transcript.

**Why.** The key is pressed by a person looking at the line that draws the mode, so it is as much a
choice as the flag is. Gating the key behind the flag would make a person who decides mid-session to
stop being asked restart the session.

What holds against that choice is `permissions.bypassUnreachable`, which any layer may write
and an administrator may pin ([PERM-18](permissions.md#PERM-18)). It is checked where the flag is
read and where the key is read, so the two cannot disagree about whether the mode is available.

<a id="MODE-6"></a>
### MODE-6: no mode answers a question a rule already refused

A deny rule from the settings file holds in every mode, including the one that asks about nothing. It
refuses before there is anything to prompt about, so there is no prompt for a mode to answer. A mode
stops the asking; it does not discard what somebody wrote down.

**Why.** This looks like the mode working, which is what makes it worth stating. A flag that quietly
undid a `deny` rule would take protection away at the moment somebody was relying on a mode to save
them keystrokes, and the file they wrote it in is the place they would go to check.

`verified-by: bravebot_agent::turn::a_deny_rule_holds_where_every_permission_check_is_bypassed`

<a id="MODE-7"></a>
### MODE-7: no mode answers a question that is not a permission

A question the planner posed, and a line the person typed unprompted, reach the person in every mode.
Neither asks for consent: the first asks for information, and the second is the person speaking.

**Why.** An answer invented on somebody's behalf is reported to the planner as their own words, so a
mode that answered these would be putting words in the mouth of a person sitting in front of the
session. That a mode stops prompts is not a reason to think they wanted this one stopped.

`verified-by: bravebot_agent::permission_mode::no_mode_answers_for_a_line_the_person_typed`

<a id="MODE-8"></a>
### MODE-8: a mode chosen while a turn runs applies to the rest of that turn

The mode is the session's, and a turn reads it again at each decision rather than once when the
prompt is sent. A mode chosen while a turn runs governs every question and every refusal the turn
reaches after that, and the planner is told when the change matters to it: a change into plan mode
repeats the plan-mode instruction, and a change out of it says the refusal has ended. A change
between the other modes says nothing, as MODE-1 says nothing of them. An answer is credited in the
trail to the mode the question was put in, so a mode chosen over a prompt already on screen does not
take credit for the answer given to it.

**Why.** A person who presses the key while a turn runs is telling the session what they want from
then on. A turn that kept the mode it began with would go on writing after the person pressed the
key to stop it, and nothing on screen would say the key had not applied yet. A question already on
screen is left as it is: the answer to it is the person's, and the mode they chose over it does not
withdraw it.

<a id="MODE-9"></a>
### MODE-9: a delegate inherits the mode of the turn that spawned it

Both halves: the prompts a delegate's work raises are answered against that mode, and the delegate's
own planner is told it. A delegate holds the same handle on the mode as the turn that spawned it, so
a mode chosen while it runs applies to it too (MODE-8).

**Why.** A delegate is the spawning turn's work done somewhere else, so a session that is planning
must not write through one. The enforcing half holds because a delegate's prompts travel back to the
same person; the telling half has to be passed deliberately, and without it a delegate's planner
reads refusals it cannot account for and retries.

**What the mode is read beside travels with it.** Where the spawning turn asked for screening
([MODE-4](#MODE-4)), so did the delegate. The confirmer a delegate is lent is that turn's, screening
by what that turn was asked for, so a delegate left at the default is the one run whose check is not
made and whose filled-in verdict is read anyway: every release inside it refused on a word nothing
said.

<a id="MODE-10"></a>
### MODE-10: a mode belongs to the sitting it was chosen in

A mode is not written into the session record. A resumed session opens by asking, whatever the
session that wrote the record was doing when it ended, and `--resume` with the flag in MODE-5 opens
in bypass because the flag was given again.

**Why.** The two standing grants a resume restores, the trust map and the vouched commands, are
decisions about the future that their owner made deliberately ([sessions.md](sessions.md) is what
keeps them). A mode is an answer somebody gave while watching one piece of work. Coming back
tomorrow into a session that had stopped asking about writes, with nothing chosen today, is the
wrong direction for this to be wrong in.

### MODE-11: the desktop offers asking, accepting edits and planning, one mode per open session

The desktop window offers three of the four modes: asking, accepting edits and planning. Bypassing
is not among them and no request reaches it. The window has no command line for the flag in MODE-5
to be given on, so a request naming bypass is refused rather than read as another mode.

The mode belongs to one open session, and every session opens asking, a resumed session and a fork
included (MODE-10). The bridge holds it, rather than each turn's request carrying it, because a
watch starts a turn that no request asked for, and that turn runs in the mode the window shows. A
turn or a manifest run holds the session's own handle on the mode, so a change while one runs is
accepted and applies to the rest of it (MODE-8).

**Why.** Refusing bypass rather than reading it as asking keeps a window from drawing a mode its
session is not in. A fork opens asking rather than taking its parent's mode for MODE-10's reason: a
mode is an answer somebody gave while watching one piece of work, and a fork is a session begun
again.

### MODE-12: `/plan` sets plan mode, with the same standing as the key, and sends only its task

`/plan` sets the session to plan mode from whichever mode it is in, and `/plan <task>` also starts a
turn on the task. The turn begins in plan mode, and what it is sent is the task
after the word, never the typed line. Typed while a turn runs it waits for that turn to end. No command sets bypassing, which stays reachable only as MODE-5 says.

**Why.** Plan mode only narrows what is permitted, so a typed word carries the same endorsement as
the key that reaches it, and a person who wants one read-only request has one line to say so. A
word for bypassing would let a session reach the one mode MODE-5 keeps to the command line.

## Known costs

- **Bypassing is one key press past planning.** The ladder ends there, so a person leaving plan mode
  with the key passes through it, and a press that is one too many lands in the mode that asks about
  nothing. The line under the box names it in colour, and the next press returns to asking. A machine
  that should not allow this says so with `permissions.bypassUnreachable` (MODE-5).
- **Accepting edits accepts a write to any path the workspace reaches.** The mode answers the write
  prompt, and the prompt is the only thing that would have shown the person the path. A rule in the
  settings file is what narrows it, and a `deny` rule still holds (MODE-6); the mode itself does not
  distinguish one file from another. The one write it does not accept is one the credential scan
  found something in, and that is decided by the finding, not the path.
- **Accepting edits still stops on a file that is only one rare value.** The shape a created
  credential takes is also the shape of a file holding only a commit id, a UUID or a digest, so
  those writes are put to the person in a mode chosen so as not to be asked about writes. `a` is
  what stops it asking again about that file. The alternative was the mode approving a value nobody
  saw, which is the shape most prompt reports have taken: an answer given in one place covering
  something the person was never shown.
- **A body nobody vouched for is written unasked by a mode that answers writes.** The scan does not
  read content that arrived as quarantined bytes, so a write carrying one through a reference raises
  no finding and the mode answers it as it answers any other write. Scanning it would be the driver
  deciding on untrusted bytes. The credential spec's Known costs record the same bound.
- **Bypassing gives up injection containment for files that are read.** Vouching is what decides
  whether a file's contents are shown to the planner or held behind a reference, so in that mode a
  file holding instructions rather than data is read as instructions. The guarantee that untrusted
  content cannot *decide* what happens is structural and still holds; what goes is the narrower
  protection of not showing the planner bytes nobody vouched for. This is why the mode is for a
  sandbox rather than for a working machine.
- **Plan mode constrains writes, not everything a turn can do.** Commands are asked about, or
  answered by a rule written in advance, and an approved command may write whatever it likes: it
  runs with the access the person's own shell has. The mode refuses the write tools rather than
  making the turn incapable of changing anything. [sandboxing.md](sandboxing.md) is what confines a
  process.
- **`defaultMode` in the settings file selects no mode.** The key is parsed so a file carrying it is
  not rejected, and a person who wrote `acceptEdits` there gets the prompts they would have got
  without it. The command line and the mode key are what choose a mode.
