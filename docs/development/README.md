# Development

Requires a recent stable Rust toolchain.

```sh
cargo build
cargo test
make check     # fmt, clippy -D warnings, tests, and toolchain age: what CI enforces
```

The desktop front end is built from `ui/`, and additionally needs Node 22.12+:

```sh
cd ui
npm ci
npm run dev    # builds bravebot-rpc and bravebot-ui-files, then starts Electron
```

`cargo build` at the root already compiles those two binaries, as workspace members like
any other; `npm run dev` builds them through `ui/scripts/build-bridge.sh`, which loads
backend credentials where a checkout has them. What a built binary holds is
[configuration.md](configuration.md), and the front end's own commands, packaging and
tests are [ui/docs/development.md](../../ui/docs/development.md).
