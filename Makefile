# `npm ci`, never `install`: the lockfile is what CI lints and a resolve on the spot is a
# dependency change. Its install hooks run, and have to: the packager copies the Electron runtime
# into the bundle, and that runtime is what the hook fetches. electron-vite is then run directly
# rather than through `npm run build`, which would build the debug pair again on the way past.
#
# Nothing here signs or notarises the result, so the bundle is installable and not distributable;
# the job that signs the binaries is where that belongs, and issue #394 is where it is decided.
# It is fused, as a release is, so it runs no Node program it is handed and Playwright cannot
# drive it: `npm run package` in ui/ is the bundle the drivers attach to.

# The desktop application's Linux release assets, built on a Linux host from what the cross-build

#
# for <arch> arm64 and amd64, from `make linux-amd64 linux-arm64 strip`, and needing no Rust
# toolchain. Two steps for the same reason the Mac is two: `app-bundles-linux` writes a fused,
# unsigned directory per architecture under ui/dist/, and `app-packages-linux` puts each one in
# its packages. Signing them, and the repository that would serve updates, are issue #770.
#
# The packages are what is shipped rather than a tarball or an AppImage, and the reason is
# Chromium's sandbox. Where unprivileged user namespaces are unavailable, which Ubuntu 24.04's
# AppArmor policy makes the default, Electron needs `chrome-sandbox` owned by root with mode 4755
# and otherwise aborts at start. Only an installer can set that; anything a person unpacks
# themselves leaves `--no-sandbox` as the way to start it, which must not be a supported way to
# run an agent.
#
# Both architectures are packaged on one host: the packager downloads the Electron runtime for
# the architecture it is asked for, and the two tools below archive a finished tree rather than
# executing anything in it, so neither needs the machine the package is for. What is not covered
# here is installing the result, which needs a virtual machine of each supported release rather
# than a container: a container shares this kernel and its AppArmor policy, so it cannot exercise
# the sandbox the packages exist for.
