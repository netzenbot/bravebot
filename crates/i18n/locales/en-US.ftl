# The reference catalog. It owns the set of messages and the name and kind of every
# argument, so a translation can add none of its own and change no call site.
#
# Ids are kebab-case and grouped by the surface they appear on. A message is named for
# what it says, never for where it happens to sit, so moving a line between two panels
# does not rename it.
#
# What is not here: anything the planner reads. A tool's description, the preamble, and
# the sentence a refused tool answers with are interface to a model rather than prose for
# a person, and translating them would change what the agent does.


## Counting

count-turns = { $count ->
    [one] { $count } turn
   *[other] { $count } turns

## Starting up, and the words printed before an interface exists

cli-tagline = bravebot { $version }: a general-purpose agent resistant to prompt injection
cli-usage-heading = Usage:
cli-usage-interactive = Start an interactive session
cli-usage-plain = Start a session in lines, taking nothing from the terminal
cli-usage-task = Run a single task
cli-usage-piped = ...with piped input, never trusted
cli-usage-resume = Pick up a session in this directory
cli-usage-from-pr = Pick up a session linked to a pull request
cli-usage-continue = Pick up the most recent session in this directory
cli-usage-resume-task = Send a one-shot task as the next turn of a session
cli-usage-continue-task = Send a one-shot task as the next turn of the most recent session
cli-usage-fork = Fork a session and start exploring a different path
cli-usage-doctor = Check configuration and confinement
cli-usage-doctor-sandbox = Run everyday workflows under the sandbox and report which work
cli-usage-update = Print the command that updates this copy
cli-usage-bug-report = Write the version, what doctor reports and the newest log's name to a file to attach to a bug report
cli-usage-import = Import a Leo Premium subscription
cli-usage-import-providers = Import a model service Claude Code or opencode configured
cli-usage-auth-login = Sign in to a model service, listing every way when none is named
cli-usage-auth-logout = Forget an imported Leo Premium subscription or a stored gateway key
cli-usage-auth-status = Say whether a sign-in is usable, exiting 0 only if it is
cli-usage-mcp = Declare, list and approve MCP servers
cli-usage-completion = Print a shell completion script
cli-usage-shell-init = Print the shell hook that gives @bravebot the commands you ran
cli-usage-permissions = Report which permission rule decides a tool call
permissions-check-usage = permissions check takes a family and what to ask about: Read <path>, Edit <path>, Bash <program> [arguments], WebFetch <host or URL>, or Mcp <server:tool>
permissions-check-decision = decision
permissions-check-deny = deny
permissions-check-ask = ask
permissions-check-allow = allow
permissions-check-none = no rule matches, so the ordinary gates decide
permissions-check-rule = rule
permissions-check-file = file
permissions-check-granted = granted at the question for this workspace, written in { $path }
permissions-check-not-in-force = not in force: { $rule } in { $path } would allow this once it is granted at the question
cli-usage-sessions = List the sessions that keep running after the terminal closes
cli-usage-sessions-stop = Stop one of them
cli-usage-sessions-import = Copy sessions another agent kept for this directory
cli-usage-bg = Start a session that keeps running after the terminal closes
cli-usage-attach = Join a background session's terminal
cli-usage-reply = Send a prompt to an idle background session

cli-keys-heading = Interactive keys:
cli-key-send = Send

cli-key-history = Walk back through sent prompts
cli-key-history-search = Search every prompt sent
cli-key-scroll = Scroll the transcript

cli-name-a-file = Include a workspace file as trusted context

## A session in lines: no screen of its own, no colour, nothing repainted

cli-plain-opening =
    bravebot { $version } in lines, { $model }. A line is a prompt; the end of the input
    (Ctrl-D) ends the session.
# Said where `--plain` was given with something other than a terminal on stdin. The lines it reads
# are prompts, and nothing vouches for what a pipe carries.
cli-plain-needs-a-terminal =
    --plain reads what you type, so its input must be a terminal. Use -p to run one task
    with piped input, which is read as quarantined context.
# Said where --plain was given alongside another way of starting. It starts a session rather than
# describing one, so there is nothing for it to combine with.
cli-plain-takes-nothing-else =
    --plain starts a session and takes no other arguments. --incognito,
    --dangerously-skip-permissions, --settings and --agent go with it; everything else is another
    way of starting.
# Said where the startup question was not put because an earlier session here was told to remember
# the answer (TRUST-23). A session in lines has no slash commands, so the ways to be asked again are
# the ones it can name: the command in the interface that draws, or the lines in the file. The
# lines rather than the file, since a directory whose path is spelled alike shares the file.
# Said on stderr by a one-shot run that opens with a kept answer about its working directory
# or the root of the git worktree around it, naming the directory the answer was about.
cli-trusting-kept =
    trusting { $directory } (you said to remember it { $when }; to be asked again, run
    /forget-trust in bravebot, or delete the lines naming it from { $path })

cli-plain-trusting-kept =
    trusting { $directory } (you said to remember it { $when }; to be asked again, run
    /forget-trust in bravebot without --plain, or delete the lines naming it from { $path })
cli-plain-trusting-kept-root =
    trusting { $directory }, inside { $root } (you said to remember { $root } { $when }; to be asked again, run
    /forget-trust in bravebot without --plain, or delete the lines naming { $root } from { $path })

# Said when a background session is started again and its earlier conversation was read back from
# its record (BG-1).
cli-plain-resumed = Continuing this session's earlier conversation ({ $count }).

## How much a session asks before it acts, drawn under the input box
#
# The markers are Claude Code's, and deliberately: somebody who has used one of these knows what
# ⏵⏵ means at a glance, and inventing our own would make a familiar thing need reading. Asking has
# a line only in a session that was started with the flag that skips permissions: there it is the
# answer to "did it stop skipping them?", and in any other session it is what has always happened.
mode-ask = ◇ asking before it acts
mode-accept-edits = ⏵ accept edits on
mode-plan = ⏸ plan mode on
mode-bypass = ⏵⏵ bypass permissions on

cli-options-heading = Options:
cli-option-file = Include a workspace file as context (repeatable)
cli-option-session-ref = Add the newest part of an earlier session of this directory to the task (repeatable)
cli-option-add-dir = Reach into a directory outside the working one (repeatable)
cli-option-trust-workspace = Trust the working directory for this run, as answering yes to the startup question does
cli-option-settings = Read this settings file for this run, above the ones found on disk
cli-option-run-network =
    Whether programs `run` starts may reach the network. closed denies it to every one except a package
    manager's fetch, git or gh with a remote operation, curl, ssh and a stage with a remote scope
cli-option-sandbox-allow-read =
    Let programs `run` starts read this path or glob, lifting a refusal of it. Settings: sandbox.filesystem.allowRead (repeatable)

    Refuse programs `run` starts reading this path or glob. Settings: sandbox.filesystem.denyRead (repeatable)
cli-option-sandbox-allow-write =
    Let programs `run` starts write this path, which they may read too. Settings: sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite (repeatable)
cli-option-sandbox-deny-write =
    Refuse programs `run` starts writing this path, a session directory included. Settings: sandbox.filesystem.denyWrite (repeatable)
cli-option-log-level =
    How much of a failure's shape is written to the diagnostic log: error (the default), info or debug.
    Hosts, statuses and counts only, never content; an incognito session writes none
cli-option-agent = Address every turn to this definition, as /agent does for one
cli-option-system-prompt =
    Replace the opening sentence of the planner's system prompt for every turn. The rest of it stays
cli-option-append-system-prompt =
    Add this text to the planner's standing instructions for every turn, after AGENTS.md
cli-option-mode = turn (default) decides step by step; manifest plans the whole run first
cli-option-model = The model this run asks for, in place of the remembered or configured one
cli-option-advisor = A model the agent may put a question to, offered to it as the advisor tool
cli-option-tools = Offer the agent only these tools, comma separated. It cannot add one a setting removed
cli-option-no-shell = Offer the agent no tool that runs a program or reads what one printed
cli-option-effort = How hard this run asks the model to think, in place of the remembered or configured level
cli-option-print = Non-interactive. Reads piped stdin as quarantined context
cli-option-trace = Print the audit trail
cli-option-json = Print one result object on stdout instead of the reply
cli-option-json-stream = Print one event per line on stdout as the run goes, then the result object
cli-option-output-schema = Require the reply to match the JSON Schema in this file; with --json the value is in "structured"
cli-option-incognito = Write nothing to ~/.bravebot: no history, no session record, no preference
cli-option-safe =
    Load none of your own hooks, skills, definitions, MCP servers or AGENTS.md. Sign-in, model and permissions still apply
cli-option-locked =
    Like --safe, and also read no project or local settings file, and refuse --dangerously-skip-permissions
cli-locked-refuses-bypass =
    --dangerously-skip-permissions is refused with --locked: a locked run never opens the bypass mode
cli-option-vet =
    For this run, let a check answer: content it finds nothing in is promoted without asking you,
    and where nobody can be asked, anything else is kept back
cli-option-sandbox =
    How far the programs `run` starts may reach: strict, standard or off. A managed file may set a
    floor this cannot go below
cli-option-dangerously-skip-permissions =
    Bypass all permission checks. Recommended only for sandboxes with no internet access
cli-option-help = Show this message
cli-option-version = Show the version


## What a command-line run says when it cannot start

cli-unknown-option = unknown option: { $flag }
cli-completion-needs-a-shell = completion takes one of bash, zsh or fish
cli-shell-init-needs-a-shell = shell-init takes one of bash, zsh or fish
cli-bug-report-takes-nothing-else = bug-report takes no arguments
cli-update-takes-nothing-else = update takes no arguments
bug-report-no-state-directory = bug-report writes nothing in an incognito session or where there is no home directory
bug-report-not-written = the bug report was not written: { $problem }
cli-file-needs-a-path = --file requires a path
cli-session-ref-needs-an-id = --session-ref requires a session id
cli-resume-needs-an-id = --resume requires the id of a session when it goes with a task
# The flag is --resume or --continue, as typed.
cli-resume-not-with-a-manifest =
    { $flag } does not go with --mode manifest: a manifest run has no conversation to carry on from
cli-add-dir-needs-a-path = --add-dir requires an absolute path to a directory
cli-directory-ends-checkouts = { $directory } holds the working directory, so no delegate is given a checkout while it is open; start again without --add-dir { $directory } to have one
cli-settings-needs-a-path = --settings requires a path to a settings file
cli-settings-not-a-file = --settings names no file: { $path }
cli-run-network-needs-a-word = --run-network requires open or closed
cli-run-network-unknown = --run-network takes open or closed, not { $word }

# The command is the first argument, one of this program's own subcommands.
cli-tools-not-for-a-command =
    --tools and --no-shell limit the tools a session or a task is offered, and { $command } starts neither
cli-tools-not-with-a-manifest =
    --tools and --no-shell do not go with --mode manifest: a manifest run's steps are planned and run from the plan, not chosen from a list of tools
cli-agent-needs-a-name = --agent requires the name of a definition
# The command is the first argument, one of this program's own subcommands.
cli-agent-not-for-a-command =
    --agent names the definition a session or a task works under, and { $command } starts neither
cli-agent-not-with-a-manifest =
    --agent does not go with --mode manifest: a manifest run plans every step before any runs,
    and a definition is addressed a turn at a time
# The flag is --system-prompt or --append-system-prompt, as typed.
cli-system-prompt-needs-text = { $flag } requires the text to use
# The flag is --system-prompt or --append-system-prompt, and the command one of this program's own

cli-system-prompt-not-for-a-command =
    { $flag } gives words to a session or a task, and { $command } starts neither
cli-system-prompt-not-with-a-manifest =
    { $flag } does not go with --mode manifest: the planner of a manifest run does not read it
# Said where a run with -p is given a --agent name it did not resolve, with the names it did.
cli-agent-no-such-definition = there is no definition called { $name }; this run resolved { $names }
# The same, where the project holds definitions the run did not read. It gives a count and never a
# name, because a file name in an untrusted directory is untrusted content.
cli-agent-no-such-definition-unread =
    { $count ->
        [one] there is no definition called { $name }; this run resolved { $names }. 1 definition in .bravebot/agents was not read: -p asks no trust question, so it reads only ~/.bravebot/agents
       *[other] there is no definition called { $name }; this run resolved { $names }. { $count } definitions in .bravebot/agents were not read: -p asks no trust question, so it reads only ~/.bravebot/agents
    }
# Said where the agent setting names a definition this run or session in lines did not resolve. It
# goes on without one, so the reason follows (ADDRESS-13).
cli-agent-setting-gone =
    the agent setting names { $definition }, which was not resolved: going on without a definition
# Said when a session in lines started with --agent opens (CLI-17). It has no slash commands, so it
# names no way to address another definition. The model is the one the definition names.
cli-plain-working-under = every prompt is addressed to { $definition }
cli-plain-working-under-model = every prompt is addressed to { $definition }, which asks for { $model }
# The flag that asks to be asked about nothing, where a settings layer made that mode unreachable.
# The file is named because the flag is documented and works everywhere else, so a refusal without
# it sends somebody looking for a fault in the program.
cli-bypass-unreachable =
    --dangerously-skip-permissions is refused: permissions.bypassUnreachable in { $path } makes
    that mode unreachable here. Remove it there, or run without the flag.
cli-sandbox-needs-a-mode = --sandbox requires one of { $names }
# The file that holds the floor is named, and the file that asked when there was one, because a
# refusal that names neither sends somebody looking for a fault in the program.
cli-sandbox-refused-flag =
    --sandbox { $asked } is refused: { $pinned_in } sets sandbox.mode to { $pinned }, and a run may
    be stricter than that but not looser. Run with --sandbox { $pinned } or stricter, or without the flag.
cli-sandbox-refused-file =
    sandbox.mode { $asked } in { $asked_in } is refused: { $pinned_in } sets sandbox.mode to { $pinned },
    and a run may be stricter than that but not looser. Change it there, or remove it.
cli-sandbox-refused-network-flag =
    --sandbox { $asked } is refused: { $pinned_in } pins run.network to closed, and a program started
    with no sandbox is not held to that. Run with --sandbox standard or stricter, or without the flag.
cli-sandbox-refused-network-file =
    sandbox.mode { $asked } in { $asked_in } is refused: { $pinned_in } pins run.network to closed, and
    a program started with no sandbox is not held to that. Change it there, or remove it.
cli-mode-needs-a-name = --mode requires one of { $names }
cli-model-needs-a-name = --model requires the name of a model
cli-advisor-needs-a-name = --advisor requires the name of a model
cli-advisor-not-with-a-manifest = --advisor cannot be used with --mode manifest, which runs its plan without a planner to ask
cli-effort-needs-a-level = --effort requires one of { $levels }
cli-output-schema-needs-a-path = --output-schema requires the path of a JSON Schema file
cli-output-schema-not-with-a-manifest = --output-schema cannot be used with --mode manifest, which has a reply for each step and none for the run
cli-output-schema-not-served = --output-schema cannot be used with { $model }, which cannot be asked for a reply that matches a schema
cli-output-schema-unreadable = cannot read the output schema { $path }: { $problem }

cli-output-schema-not-an-object = in the output schema { $path }, { $at } is not a JSON object
cli-output-schema-unsupported = the output schema { $path } uses { $keyword } at { $at }, which is not supported
cli-output-schema-malformed = the output schema { $path } gives { $keyword } at { $at } a value it cannot take
cli-output-schema-mismatch = the reply does not match the output schema at { $at }: { $problem }
cli-output-schema-rule-not-json = the reply is not a single JSON value
cli-output-schema-rule-type = the value is of another type
cli-output-schema-rule-enum = the value is not one of those listed
cli-output-schema-rule-const = the value is not the one allowed
cli-output-schema-rule-required = a required property is missing
cli-output-schema-rule-extra = a property the schema does not list is present
cli-output-schema-rule-length = the string is shorter or longer than allowed
cli-output-schema-rule-count = the array has fewer or more items than allowed

cli-interface-problem = interface error: { $problem }
cli-directory-unknown = cannot tell which directory this is
cli-no-such-session = no session { $id } in this directory
cli-manifest-run = { $id } is a manifest run, so there is nothing to continue; this is what it did
cli-nothing-to-continue = no session to continue in this directory
cli-from-pr-needs-a-value = --from-pr requires a pull request number or address
cli-fork-needs-a-name = --fork requires a session id
cli-piped-input-unreadable = warning: could not read piped input: { $problem }
cli-piped-input-too-large =
    piped input is larger than { $limit } MiB. Write it to a file and name that instead


## What a run says when no model service is configured

# Said instead of starting work at all. A session opened with nothing configured reads as the agent
# being poor rather than as nothing having been set up yet, so the first run says what to configure
# instead of starting work that has no service to do it.
onboarding-no-model = no model service is configured yet
# Said beside it where a subscription is stored and could not be read, because somebody in that
# case is one import away rather than a whole configuration away.
onboarding-subscription-unusable = the subscription that is stored could not be used: { $problem }
# Said before the routes where Claude Code or opencode configures a service bravebot can use, or a
# running Ollama serves one, and nobody was there to be asked about it: a one-shot run, --json, a
# pipe, or doctor.
onboarding-import-one =
    { $source } configures a model service bravebot can use: run `bravebot auth login import` in a terminal to import it.
# The same, where the one source is Ollama running on this machine.
onboarding-import-running =
    { $source } is running here with models bravebot can use: run `bravebot auth login import` in a terminal to import it.
onboarding-import-both =
    { $first } and { $second } each have a model service bravebot can use: run `bravebot auth login import` in a terminal to import them.
onboarding-import-three =
    { $first }, { $second } and { $third } each have a model service bravebot can use: run `bravebot auth login import` in a terminal to import them.
# Said instead, where a service is configured and only the model in force is Brave's own. A
# settings block copied out of another tool names its models and names no default, so this is
# where somebody following that route lands, and what they have to do is name one of their own.
onboarding-name-a-configured-model =
    A service is configured, but the model in force is one of Brave's: name one of your own with the `model` key in ~/.bravebot/settings.json, or with --model on a one-shot run. `bravebot doctor` lists what each configured service offers.
onboarding-pick-one = Configure one of these, then run bravebot again:
onboarding-bedrock =
    AWS Bedrock, through your own account: put a `provider` block named `amazon-bedrock` in ~/.bravebot/settings.json, with its region and the models to offer.
onboarding-openrouter =
    OpenRouter, or any other OpenAI-compatible gateway: put a `provider` block named for it in ~/.bravebot/settings.json, with the variable that holds its API key and the models to offer.
# Last of the three, and said to be last, because these models are reached through Brave's AI
# gateway, which has open problems of its own. It is still the shortest route for somebody who
# already subscribes, so it is offered rather than left out.
onboarding-leo =
    Brave Leo Premium, if you already subscribe: run `bravebot auth login leo` on a machine where Brave is signed in to that subscription. It reaches models through Brave's AI gateway, which has open issues being worked on, so prefer one of the two above for now.
# Said after either, so it reads after the three routes and after the one line alike.
onboarding-where-to-read =
    There are worked examples in https://github.com/brave/bravebot/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md#choosing-a-model-service


## What a finished one-shot run says beside the reply

cli-notice = note: { $notice }
cli-model-used = model: { $model }
cli-something-was-refused = note: a policy gate refused something during this turn
cli-resume-heading = Resume this session with:
# When /cd moved the session, the shell this is printed into is not where the record is, and
# --resume looks an id up under the directory it runs in.
cli-resume-moved = This session moved to { $directory }. Resume it from there with:

doctor-model-set-aside = { $model } (default, since { $pick }, chosen with /model, is not served by any configured service)
# The other reason a pick is not in force. Not the line above: a model the machine's layer refuses is

# The line under this one names the file that refused.

# What would end each credential this build holds for itself: who issued it, the surface that
# revokes it, and anything minted from it that revoking it would not reach. Written down here
# because the moment somebody needs it is the moment it is too late to work out, and because the
# disposition people reach for, deleting the local copy, ends this machine's custody and nothing
# else. One line per credential, and both AWS arrangements where an account is configured, since
# which one a profile resolves to is the AWS CLI's answer and this report asks it only whether the
# account is signed in. One per gateway a settings file configured too, so each names the host that
# would end its token.
doctor-ends = ends
doctor-ends-signing-key =
    the signing key: issued by the Brave backend, which derives its copy from a master seed and this key id; ended only by retiring that id there and shipping another build, since one build's key is every install's
doctor-ends-aws-access-key =
    a long-lived access key: issued by AWS IAM to the user the profile names; ended with `aws iam delete-access-key`
doctor-ends-aws-session =
    a session credential: issued by AWS STS for the profile, and this program asks the AWS CLI for another as it builds each request, so the expiry ends that copy rather than this program's access; ended at its issuer, since `aws sso logout` clears this machine's copy rather than the session behind it, and the next one is minted from whatever the profile chains to, for as long as that lasts
doctor-ends-gateway-token =
    a gateway bearer token: issued by { $gateway }, which is also the only surface that revokes it; deleting it from the settings file, unsetting the variable or running `bravebot auth logout gateway` ends this machine's custody and leaves the token live there
doctor-ends-subscription-batch =
    an imported subscription's credential batch: minted by Brave's subscription service against the order this install registered as a device on; each credential is spent by one premium request and the batch stops working when its last window closes, and nothing revokes an unspent one, so `bravebot auth logout leo` ends this machine's custody and leaves the batch spendable by whatever copied the file
# Which tier the gate walk left a credential on, shown under the account of what would end it. One
# sentence per tier rather than per credential: the tier is where the walk stopped, and what is
# particular to a credential is the line above this one. Delegated is here although nothing stands
# there, so the first credential that does is not reported as the tier below it.
doctor-tier = tier
doctor-tier-delegated =
    delegated: nothing is held here, and something this program cannot impersonate decides each use and can refuse it
doctor-tier-granted =
    granted: a real secret, bounded before it was issued to what the issuer will accept it for, and enforced where this program cannot reach
doctor-tier-held-briefly =
    held briefly: a real secret whose lifetime, rather than its reach, is what its issuer enforces
doctor-tier-held =
    held: a permanent secret, bounded by the surface that revokes it and by nothing else
# How quickly a leak of a credential would be noticed and acted on, shown for the one arrangement
# whose bound is a window rather than a revocation. The figure is this deployment's judgement and
# not a fact about the credential: it decides whether the window is short enough for what the
# credential reaches, and it neither sets the tier nor moves it.
doctor-noticed = noticed
doctor-noticed-aws-session =
    within about { $minutes } minutes, and only where somebody is reading the account's trail: a call made with the session appears there rather than here, nothing on this machine watches for one, and ending it before its expiry is a request at its issuer
# Shown only for a credential something is minted from that ending it would not reach, because
# a line reading "nothing" for the other two is the one people learn to skip.
doctor-outlives = outlives
doctor-outlives-aws-access-key =
    a session credential STS already issued under that access key, which runs to its own expiry: deleting the key does not reach it
# Whether a derived credential is bound to the party that presents it. Shown only for the
# credentials minted from something else. A bearer secret is usable by whatever holds a copy, and the
# two bearer sentences keep apart an issuer that offers no bound form from one nobody has asked.
doctor-binding = binding
doctor-binding-sender-constrained =
    sender-constrained: the issuer checks who presents it, so a copy taken from this machine is of no use elsewhere

    a bearer secret: whatever holds a copy can use it until it expires, and its issuer offers no form that is bound to the presenter
doctor-binding-bearer-not-attempted =

mcp-call-stand = Yes, and stop asking for { $tool } in this project
mcp-call-cannot-stand = not offered: nothing answered in this session can be recorded
mcp-call-no = No
mcp-call-expand = (e to expand)
mcp-call-collapse = (e to collapse)
mcp-call-not-recorded =
    { $tool } was called, and your answer to stop asking could not be recorded, so the next call
    asks again: { $error }
mcp-call-path-not-one-line = the project's path cannot be written on one line
# Why a record of answers under the state directory was left as it is rather than written over.
mcp-record-too-large = it is larger than a record of answers has any reason to be, so it was left as it is
mcp-record-not-read = it could not be read as text, so it was left as it is

## A remote MCP server whose reply pointed somewhere it is not declared

mcp-move-title = declare this server where its reply points?
mcp-move-declared = { $alias } is declared at { $url }
mcp-move-destination = and its reply points to { $url }
mcp-move-reaching = reaching { $authority }
mcp-move-explained =
    Nothing was sent there. A yes declares the server at that address and sends it what was being
    sent, and every later request to the server goes there too, in this session and the next. Say
    no unless you know the server moved.
mcp-move-this-session-only = nothing answered in this session is recorded, so a yes lasts until it ends
mcp-move-yes = Yes, it moved there
mcp-move-no = No
mcp-move-declined =
    { $alias } stays where it is declared: its reply pointed somewhere else, and nothing was sent there
mcp-move-not-started =
    { $alias } was not started: its reply to the handshake pointed somewhere it is not declared, and
    nothing was sent there
mcp-move-refused-by-managed = { $alias } was not moved where its reply points: { $reason }
mcp-move-undeclarable = { $alias } was not moved: where its reply points cannot be declared: { $problem }
mcp-move-moved = { $alias } was moved where its reply pointed
mcp-move-edited =
    { $alias } was not moved: its declaration changed while you were asked, so it was left as it is
mcp-move-not-recorded =
    { $alias } is used where its reply pointed in this session only, since the move could not be
    recorded: { $error }
mcp-move-no-handshake = { $alias } did not complete its handshake where its reply pointed: { $reason }
mcp-move-again = { $alias } was redirected again, off where it was just moved, so that was refused

## Programs asking for one more path for the session

path-title = let programs reach another path?
path-reads = programs this session starts may read { $path }
path-writes = programs this session starts may read and write { $path }
path-why = the planner says: { $why }
path-explained =
    Every command the planner runs from now until this session ends gets it. Nothing is written to
    disk, so the next session asks again. /reach paths lists what was allowed and
    /reach paths remove <number> ends one.
path-not-trusted =
    The directory is not marked trusted: what is in it is still labelled as it was, and a file
    there is no more believed than before.
path-yes = Yes, for this session
path-no = No
path-listed = { $number }. every command also { $access } { $path }, for this session
path-none = no path was requested this session
path-removed = ended: commands no longer { $access } { $path }
path-refused-number = no requested path is numbered { $number }
path-usage = /reach paths lists the paths programs were allowed to reach this session. /reach paths remove <number> ends one.

## Vouching for a directory, asked once when a session starts somewhere new

trust-directory-title = trust this directory?
trust-directory-question = Trust
trust-directory-explained =
    Files here will be read as trusted, and edits to them will not be shown to you one by
    one. Say no if you did not write this code.
trust-directory-regardless =
    Either way, anything derived from the web or from an untrusted file is still shown
    before it is written.
trust-directory-yes = trust it
trust-directory-no = ask me about every write
# The key that keeps the answer for later sessions (TRUST-23). Offered only where it can be written
# down, and its lines say what it covers and where it goes, since nobody can endorse a record they
# were not shown.
trust-directory-remember = trust and remember
trust-directory-remember-explained =
    r: trust it, and skip this question in later sessions started in this directory, or below it if it is a git root
trust-directory-remember-exact =
    A session started above it is still asked, and so is one in a nested repository or in a directory deleted and made again here.
trust-directory-remember-where = /forget-trust takes it back, and it is written down here:
# Above the keys while the lines saying what r does and where it writes have not been on the screen
# together, which is when r is not taken. What r does comes first, so a narrow terminal that cuts the
# line off keeps it.
trust-directory-remember-unseen = ↑↓ r remembers nothing: what it writes is not shown yet
# The same where those lines are taller than the box, so no scroll shows them together.
trust-directory-remember-too-small = r remembers nothing: what it writes is taller than this box
quit = quit
trust-quit-again = again


## Opening a directory a settings file named, asked once for each when a session starts

named-directory-title = open this directory?
named-directory-question = Open
named-directory-explained =
    A settings file asked for this directory to be opened beside the one you are working in.
    Opening it lets files there be read and edited, and read as trusted.
named-directory-regardless =
    A file cannot open a directory on its own. Say no and this session runs without it; /add-dir
    opens one at any time.
named-directory-yes = open it
named-directory-no = leave it closed


## Granting the allow rules a checkout's settings file proposed, asked once for the whole list

# One question for every rule, listing each with the file it came from. The list is what makes the
# answer consent to specific grants rather than a feeling about the tree, and one box per rule would
# be thirty answers nobody reads.
granted-rules-title = grant these permission rules?
granted-rules-question = This project's settings ask to stop you being asked about:
granted-rules-explained =
    Each of these answers an approval prompt you would otherwise see: running a program, writing a
    file, or fetching a URL. They were written by whoever wrote this project, not by you.
granted-rules-regardless =
    A project cannot grant itself these. Say no and this session asks about each action as usual;
    rules in ~/.bravebot/settings.json are your own and always apply.
granted-rules-yes = grant them
granted-rules-no = keep asking me
# Above the keys while a rule has not yet been on the screen with its file, which is when y is not
# taken: a key that did nothing and said nothing would read as a question that had stopped answering.
# What y does comes first, so a narrow terminal that cuts the line off keeps it.
granted-rules-unseen =
    { $count ->
        [one] ↑↓ y grants nothing: { $count } rule not shown yet
       *[other] ↑↓ y grants nothing: { $count } rules not shown yet
    }
# The same where a rule not shown yet is taller than the box, so no scroll shows it whole.

# answers: the info panel and /status. The tier word alone would read as the Brave roster's model of
# that name.
model-label-bedrock = { $name } (Bedrock)
# Both rosters are offered at once, and a tier name alone does not say which of the two it is: the

## Approving a write

write-title = approve this write?
write-create = Create
write-overwrite = Overwrite
write-edit = Edit
write-tally = +{ $added } -{ $removed }
write-too-large-to-show =
    the change is too large to show: { $added } lines replace { $removed }
write-untrusted = untrusted: nobody has read this, and the model never saw it
write-remark =
    what the isolated processor said about this change, which nothing has checked against it
write-credentials =
    this looks like it would put a secret in the tree, going by the name beside the value and how
    the value reads. Nothing recognised it as a particular provider's key, so it is a guess and
    yours to settle
write-since-checkout =
    this session wrote to this file in the working directory after the checkout was made, so it
    may hold changes the checkout's copy does not. Read the difference before approving
write-line-endings-kept = line endings: { $ending } kept
write-line-endings-changed = line endings: { $from } to { $to }
write-line-endings-new = line endings: { $ending }
write-unchanged = { $count ->

write-always-explained =
    a: stop asking whether this file may hold a secret, for the rest of this session
write-always-this-file = this file only: the same name in another directory is asked about again
write-always-only-the-secret =
    it settles the secret only: a write that would be asked about anyway still is
write-remember-explained = r: stop asking whether this file may hold a secret, from now on
write-remember-every-session = every session started in this directory reads it, not just this one
write-remember-where = it is written down here, and deleting the line is the way back:
write-yes = write it
write-always = always this session
write-remember = remember it
write-no = leave it alone


## Approving a command

run-title = run this?
run-verb = Run
run-stages = { $count ->
    [one] { $count } stage
   *[other] { $count } stages
    }
run-in-directory = in { $directory }
watching-list-command = command
# The same column on a background job's row. The job's name leads the line beside it.
watching-list-job = background
# The row and the view for a question asked beside the work, which is what /btw sends.
watching-list-aside = aside
watching-aside-head = a question asked beside the work
watching-aside-question = you asked
watching-aside-answer = the answer, which the conversation has not read
watching-aside-not-kept = this answer is on your screen only: the conversation had read something untrusted, so the record does not keep it
watching-aside-gone = the record could not keep this answer, so it did not come back with the session
watching-lines = { $count ->
    [one] 1 line
   *[other] { $count } lines
    }
watching-output-head = what this command printed
# The name is the one the driver gave the job, never anything the job printed.
watching-output-job-head = what background { $name } printed
watching-output-read = the model has read this
watching-output-kept = the model has not read this
# Short enough to stand in a column beside a command line. The whole sentence is in the header of
# the view the row opens.
watching-row-read = read
watching-row-kept = not read
# The same column on an aside's row, where the question is not whether the model read the answer
# but whether the record keeps it.
watching-row-kept-answer = kept
watching-row-screen-only = screen only
watching-output-more = { $count ->
    [one] 1 more line was printed and is not kept
   *[other] { $count } more lines were printed and are not kept
    }
run-line-sent = the model wrote:
run-writes = it writes these files:
run-is-fed = it is fed the contents of:
run-not-sandboxed = this is not sandboxed: it runs with the access your own shell has
# Said instead of the line above where the turn confines what a run starts, and followed by the
# directories it is held to and by one sentence for each toolchain and credential a stage brings.
run-confined = its files are confined to these directories, the system temporary directory and the system files every program needs:
run-confined-machine = it can read this machine except the places that hold a credential, and write only these directories, the system temporary directory and the toolchain caches:
run-carries-known-hosts = { $program } also adds to your ssh known hosts and can reach your ssh agent
run-carries-toolchain = { $program } also reaches the install and the cache of the { $toolchain } toolchain
run-carries-loopback = { $program } can also listen on, and connect to, ports of this machine
run-carries-remote = { $program } also reads your git and gh logins, your ssh configuration and public keys, never a private key, and adds to your ssh known hosts
run-carries-aws = { $program } also reads your aws credentials in ~/.aws
run-carries-kubernetes = { $program } also reads your kubernetes credentials in ~/.kube
run-carries-docker = { $program } also reads your docker credentials in ~/.docker
run-carries-signing = { $program } also reads the public key your git configuration signs with, and signs through your ssh agent, never reading a private key
run-carries-reach = { $program } also reads { $path }, where your { $variable } points
run-network-closed = the network is closed for programs this session starts, except for those below
run-keeps-network = { $program } also reaches the network
# Said for reach a person attached to a command with /reach. The date is the day they allowed it,
# so the row is never a surprise: the reach is on the screen every time the command is asked about.
run-carries-requested = { $sentence } (asked for by the planner for this line)
run-carries-remembered = { $sentence } (remembered for this command, allowed { $date })
run-carries-remembered-read = { $program } also reads { $path } (remembered for this command, allowed { $date })
run-carries-remembered-write = { $program } also reads and writes { $path } (remembered for this command, allowed { $date })
# The /reach command: what it lists, what it says it did, and why it did nothing.
reach-usage = /reach lists the reach remembered for commands. /reach <remote|aws|kubernetes|docker|directory> [write] [always] -- <command> remembers it for that command. /reach remove <number> forgets one. /reach paths lists the paths a session was let reach, and /reach paths remove <number> ends one.
reach-none = no reach is remembered for any command
reach-listed = { $number }. { $command } also { $access } { $entry }, allowed { $date }, { $lifetime }
reach-access-reads = reads
reach-access-writes = reads and writes
reach-lifetime-session = for this session
reach-lifetime-always = always
reach-lifetime-session-in = for this session in { $workspace }
reach-lifetime-always-in = always in { $workspace }
reach-added = remembered: { $command } also { $access } { $entry }, { $lifetime }. The next plan for it shows this row.
reach-removed = forgotten: { $command } no longer also { $access } { $entry }
reach-refused-entry = { $entry } is not a credential scope (remote, aws, kubernetes, docker) or a directory that can be reached. It must be an absolute path or start with ~/, exist, and not be your home directory, ~/.ssh, or a directory above them.
reach-refused-write = a credential scope is read only. Only a directory can be written.
reach-refused-line = that command line cannot be run as written, so there is nothing to remember the reach for
reach-refused-assignment = a command with NAME=value in front of it carries no remembered reach
reach-refused-option = a command that starts with an option, such as `sh -c ...` or `git -C dir push`, cannot carry a remembered reach. Name the operation first, as in `git push`.
reach-refused-workspace = this directory cannot be told apart from another made at the same path, so a reach for this command cannot be tied to it
reach-refused-incognito = this session adds nothing to ~/.bravebot, so nothing was remembered
reach-refused-no-home = this session has no home directory to judge a reach against
reach-refused-number = no reach is numbered { $number }
run-filesystem-rules = your own filesystem rules apply to these programs: { $allow_read } allowRead, { $deny_read } denyRead, { $allow_write } allowWrite, { $deny_write } denyWrite
# Said above the list of what a line reaches that nothing here holds: no credential is handed
# over, nobody is asked at the moment it is used, and nothing here can take the access back. Said
# only where a line reaches one, so the list is never empty and never noise. The line above is
# said either way: this names what is being granted, rather than replacing what confinement there
# is with a list.
run-spends-authority = it also spends access that is yours elsewhere, which nobody is asked for and nothing here takes back:
run-authority-container = { $named }: the container daemon, which runs anything as root on this machine
run-authority-logged-in = { $named }: already logged in, so it acts as you without asking you
run-authority-agent = { $named }: your ssh agent, which signs with keys it never hands over
run-authority-metadata = { $named }: this machine's metadata service, which hands out the credentials of the role it runs as
run-releases-private = it is also being fed your own data, which leaves here with it
run-always-explained = a: trust this exact command for the rest of this session
run-always-means-both = which means both:
run-always-runs-again = it runs again unasked, side effects and all
run-always-output-trusted = what it prints is trusted, and the model reads it
run-always-exact-arguments = these arguments only: git log would not cover git push
run-always-this-directory = this directory only: the same line elsewhere is asked about again
run-private-not-remembered =
    private input is asked about every time, so this one cannot be remembered
run-assignment-not-remembered =
    an assignment in front of a program is asked about every time, so this one cannot be remembered
run-write-not-remembered =
    a line naming a file to write is asked about every time, so this one cannot be remembered
run-stdin-not-remembered =
    a line fed a reference is asked about every time, so this one cannot be remembered
run-unconfined = the planner asked for this one line to run with no sandbox: no profile holds it, and the next line is held to the session's mode again
run-unconfined-not-remembered =
    a line the planner asked to run with no sandbox is asked about every time, so neither the line nor the request is remembered
run-scopes-not-remembered =
    a line the planner asked to carry a credential scope, toolchain list or loopback is asked every time, so it cannot be remembered
# Said only where the plan asked for a credential scope and a record of reach can be written. The
# lines under it are the programs, each with its operation word, as `/reach` lists them.
run-keep-reach-explained = m: also remember the requested reach for these commands, so the next plan for them carries it
run-keep-reach-scopes = the reach remembered is { $scopes }, read only
run-keep-reach-still-asked = the line is still asked about every time, with that reach shown on it, and nothing it prints is trusted
run-keep-reach-lifetimes = m lasts for this session. e lasts until removed, in this checkout, or in every checkout for a program the scope belongs to, such as git for remote.
run-keep-reach-asked-again = { $names } is not remembered: it is asked for again each time
run-keep-reach-where = it is written down here:
run-keep-reach-undo = /reach lists what is remembered, and /reach remove <number> forgets one
run-keep-reach = remember the reach
run-keep-reach-always = remember it for every session
run-remember-explained = r: stop asking about this exact line, in this directory, from now on
run-remember-where = it is written down here, and deleting the line is the way back:
run-remember-only-asking = it stops the asking only: what it prints stays quarantined
run-remember-every-session = every session started in this directory reads it, not just this one
# Said only for a sub-command the program's table lists, under the record's own rows. The line below
# it is the entry as it will be held, with the slot drawn where the number goes.
run-remember-family-explained = f: stop asking about this line with any number in place of this one, in this directory, from now on
run-remember-family-only-number = only a whole number may change: another repository, another flag or another sub-command is still asked about
# Said where the person has already answered a prompt for this binary under other arguments, which
# is the only thing a prompt can establish about a line that will be asked about however it is
# answered. No pattern is suggested: which argument carried the message is the person's to decide.
run-pattern-varies =
    these arguments differ from the ones you were asked about before, so no key here ends the asking
run-pattern-where = a pattern for the family is written in a settings file, not answered here:
run-pattern-covers-unread = a pattern covers lines nobody has read, which is more than any key here grants
run-pattern-only-asking = a pattern stops the asking and nothing else: what the line prints stays quarantined
run-yes = run it
run-always = always this session
run-remember = remember it
run-remember-family = any number
run-no = don't
# Said above the keys while a row of the plan has not been on the screen. It counts rows, which is
# what the arrows move by, and the count comes first so a narrow box does not cut it off.
run-unseen =
    { $count ->
        [one] ↑↓ { $count } row not shown: no key runs this yet
       *[other] ↑↓ { $count } rows not shown: no key runs this yet
    }
# Said once the plan has been read while the rows saying what `a` or `r` grant besides have not. The

run-grant-unseen =
    { $count ->
        [one] ↑↓ { $count } row not shown: a muted key waits on it
       *[other] ↑↓ { $count } rows not shown: a muted key waits on them

## What a check said, at the head of every prompt whose answer would promote content

# Said of a command's output, of a file somebody is being asked to vouch for, and of one slot the
# model asked about, so it says "this" rather than naming what was read: the prompt around it has
# already said which thing that is.
check-safe = the check found no attempt to give instructions in this
check-unsafe = the check says this looks like an attempt to give instructions
check-inconclusive = the check did not complete, so nothing has looked at this


## Letting the model read what a command printed

output-yes = let it read this
output-no = keep it back


## Letting the model read one quarantined slot a check has looked at

vet-title = let the model read this?

vet-from = from { $origin }
vet-unseen =
    the model has not seen this. Approving puts it in its context, and it will act on it.
vet-covers-this-only =
    this covers what is below and nothing else. No path is vouched for, so the next read of
    the same thing asks again.
vet-expected = the model asked for this expecting { $expects }
vet-empty = (there is nothing in it)
vet-yes = let it read this
# What stops is the asking, not the checking: a check runs before this prompt either way, so a
# label about vetting would name the one thing this key does not change, and would read as the
# more cautious choice when it is the looser one.
vet-always = don't ask when safe
vet-no = keep it back
# What the standing key turns on, drawn only where it is offered. Not about these bytes: it says
# that from here on a check finding nothing answers this question, and where that is written down.
vet-always-covers =
    a stops this question wherever a check finds nothing, in this session and the next, until
    you change it. Kept in ~/.bravebot/vetting.

## Letting the model see one quarantined picture or PDF a check has looked at

vet-picture-open = open this copy to see what the model would be shown. It is deleted when you answer:
# The part of the file a person reading it is most likely to miss and a model is not.
vet-picture-words =
    a model reads words in a picture that a person can miss: small, faint, or nearly the colour
    of what is behind them. Look for writing before letting it through.
# Beneath the picture a terminal that draws real pictures shows on the prompt. It says what the
# drawing is, and why the copy is still worth opening.
vet-picture-drawn =
    the picture as this terminal draws it. Small or faint writing may not show at this size: open
    the copy above and zoom in.
vet-pdf-hidden-text =
    a PDF can also hold text that no page draws, and the model is given that text too.
vet-picture-yes = let it see this


## Fetching a URL

fetch-title = fetch this?
fetch-verb = Fetch
fetch-host = talking to { $host }
# Said where the host is the metadata service of the machine this is running on, which is a host
# like any other to everything in between: it asks for no credential and hands out the ones of
# the role this machine runs as. A person shown the address alone has been shown a number.
fetch-authority-metadata =
    this is this machine's own metadata service: it asks nothing of whoever reaches it and
    answers with the credentials of the role this machine runs as.
fetch-explained =
    what comes back stays quarantined however you answer: the model can pass it to a
    processor or write it to a file, and cannot read it or be told what it says.
fetch-yes = fetch it
fetch-no = don't


## Starting a language server

server-title = start a language server?
server-verb = Start
server-workspace = to index { $workspace }

    this runs code from your project and its dependencies with your own access, the way
    building or testing the project does. it stays running for this session.
server-arguments = with { $arguments }

    you declared this server yourself, so what starting it runs is not known: it may run code
    from your project and its dependencies. it runs with your own access, and stays running for
    this session.
server-reads-only =
    it reads the project and stays running for this session. nothing is written to your
    project.
server-explained =
    what it reports stays on the same footing however you answer: a place in a file is
    shown, and the text at that place is quarantined unless you vouched for the file.
server-yes = start it
server-no = don't


## Approving a plan before it runs

plan-title = run this plan?
plan-verb = Run
plan-steps = { $count ->
    [one] { $count } step
   *[other] { $count } steps
    }

plan-explained =
    the whole program, decided before anything was read. nothing it reads can add a step,
    drop one, or send anything anywhere this plan does not already name.
plan-not-its-writes =
    approving the plan is not approving its writes. each one is still put to you as it
    comes up.
plan-nothing-yet =
    nothing has been read or written yet, so declining leaves everything as it is.
plan-yes = run it
plan-no = don't
# Where a question is a line on a terminal rather than a panel: what a yes looks like, and the one
# answer that approves. Any other line, and the end of the input, refuses. Shared by every question
# put in lines, so one affirmative covers them all.
line-answer = [y/N]
line-answer-yes = y
# The plan's own line, which names what saying yes runs.
plan-answer = run it? [y/N]


## Vouching for a quarantined file

vouch-title = let the model read this file?
vouch-verb = Trust
vouch-explained =
    the model cannot read this file, so it is working blind on it. Vouching lets it read
    this file for the rest of this session, here and in every later read.
vouch-nothing = (nothing of this file can be shown)
vouch-yes = trust it
vouch-no = leave it quarantined


## Reading a file that holds what looks like a credential

expose-title = let the model read a file holding a credential?
expose-verb = Send
expose-explained =
    the model may read this file, and what it reads goes to whoever performs inference.
    The scan found something in it that looks like a credential. Sending it discloses
    that value; declining keeps this file's text from the model and changes nothing else.
    An answer covers this file until the session ends or you change directory.
expose-found = what the scan found, without any of the value:
expose-yes = send it anyway
expose-no = keep it back

handoff-untrusted = the brief was not offered: this conversation has met something untrusted, so the new session would not be starting from what the planner could have held
handoff-failed = the brief could not be written: { $problem }
handoff-started = handed off: this is a new session, and the earlier one is as it was. To return to it, run `bravebot --resume { $id }`

# What the session says about a manifest run started from it. The plan, each step and the reply are
# shown as they happen, so what is left to say is that a run is starting, where it was written down,

skill-model-substituted = { $skill } asked for { $model } and was answered by a different model
# A project file this program would have read on its own account (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md,
# .claude/CLAUDE.md, the file one of those points at, a skill or a definition) that the person's own
# settings deny reading, so it was left out of the turn. The source is its workspace-relative path
# and stays as it is. "deny" is the name of the settings list the rule sits in.
source-denied-by-rule = { $source } was not loaded: a deny rule in your settings covers it
# An entry of "references" in the person's settings that was not offered. The alias is the name they
# gave it. One message per reason: the alias cannot be used, the entry names a repository, which
# is not fetched, the entry names no directory, and a directory that could not be opened.
reference-bad-alias = reference { $alias } was not used: an alias cannot be empty or contain /, spaces, backticks or commas
reference-repository-not-fetched = reference { $alias } was not used: an entry that names a repository is not fetched, so give it a path
reference-no-path = reference { $alias } was not used: it names no directory
reference-not-opened = reference { $alias } was not opened: { $problem }
# An `@path` line in AGENTS.md that was left as written. The import is the workspace-relative path
# and stays as it is. One message per reason: nesting or count past the limit, the file already
# being expanded further up, and a file that is outside the project, cannot be read or is untrusted.
import-too-deep = { $import } was not imported: imports are nested too deeply or there are too many
import-cycle = { $import } was not imported: a file above it already imports it

# `bravebot doctor --sandbox-check`: git, gh, make, cargo and the other everyday programs, run the way a
# session runs them. A row is a workflow; a row that failed says where, what to do, and where the
# program's output went. The output itself is never printed.
cli-doctor-sandbox-takes-nothing-else = doctor --sandbox-check takes no other arguments.
doctor-sandbox-not-here = doctor --sandbox-check runs programs under the sandbox on Linux and macOS. This platform confines programs another way, and the workflows are not run here.
doctor-sandbox-cannot-confine = This machine cannot confine a program, so there is nothing to check. bravebot doctor reports the confinement it can apply.
doctor-sandbox-no-place = There is no state directory to run the workflows in. bravebot doctor says which variables name one.
doctor-sandbox-temporary = The state directory { $path } is under the temporary directory, which the sandbox lets every program write, so a refused write could not be told from a permitted one. Move the state directory.
doctor-sandbox-io = Could not prepare { $path }: { $detail }
doctor-sandbox-passed = passed
doctor-sandbox-failed = FAILED
doctor-sandbox-skipped = skipped
doctor-sandbox-because = because
doctor-sandbox-not-installed = { $programs } is not installed

doctor-sandbox-did-not-exit = stage { $stage }, { $program }, did not exit
doctor-sandbox-fix = fix
doctor-sandbox-fix-refused = The sandbox refused something this program needs. Read the log for the path, then add the directory with --add-dir or /add-dir, or run the command yourself outside a session.
doctor-sandbox-fix-allowed = The sandbox let a program reach something it exists to keep from one. Do not rely on it until this is fixed, and report it.
doctor-sandbox-fix-without = The workflow fails without the sandbox too, so the sandbox is not the cause. Check that the program works on this machine.
doctor-sandbox-fix-setup = Setting the workflow up failed outside the sandbox. Check that the program works on this machine.
doctor-sandbox-fix-not-confined = The platform would not confine the program: { $detail }
doctor-sandbox-fix-login = gh has a login outside the sandbox that it cannot read under it. It may be kept in a file the sandbox refuses, such as a keychain other than the login keychain. Add that file to sandbox.filesystem.allowRead in your settings, or store the token in a file the sandbox lets a program read with: gh auth login --insecure-storage

session-sandbox-set = The sandbox mode is { $mode } from the next turn, for the rest of this session.
session-sandbox-set-off = The sandbox mode is off from the next turn, for the rest of this session: programs `run` starts have no profile.
session-sandbox-refused-mode =
    /sandbox { $asked } is refused: { $pinned_in } sets sandbox.mode to { $pinned }, and a session may be
    stricter than that but not looser.
session-sandbox-refused-network =
    /sandbox { $asked } is refused: { $pinned_in } pins run.network to closed, and a program started with
    no sandbox is not held to that. Use /sandbox standard or strict.
ask-sandbox-off-title = sandbox
ask-sandbox-off-header = Sandbox off
ask-sandbox-off-question = Programs `run` starts will have no profile, so nothing confines what they read, write or reach. Turn the sandbox off for the rest of this session?
ask-sandbox-off-no = No, keep { $mode }
ask-sandbox-off-yes = Yes, start programs with no profile
ask-sandbox-off-yes-detail = Applies from the next turn. /sandbox standard or /sandbox strict turns it back on.
