//! The settings files, from `~/.bravebot` and from `.bravebot` beside the work.
//!
//! A file rather than only the process environment, because the values that select a backend are
//! long-lived: which AWS profile to assume and which model each tier names are properties of a
//! person's account, not of the shell a session happened to start in. Exporting them from a shell
//! profile works and keeps working; this exists so it is not the only way.
//!
//! Three files, because an account is not the only scope a value belongs to. A profile is a
//! property of the person, a gateway a particular checkout talks to is a property of that checkout,
//! and something one machine needs is neither. The order is Claude Code's, and so are the merge
//! rules: `~/.bravebot/settings.json`, then `.bravebot/settings.json`, then
//! `.bravebot/settings.local.json`, each overriding the one before it a name at a time rather than
//! wholesale. Copying that resolution rather than inventing one means somebody who knows where to
//! put a value for one of these tools knows it for the other.
//!
//! Blocks borrowing the shape of whichever tool already reads them, so that one copied from
//! elsewhere works unedited rather than being rewritten first. A different spelling for the same
//! values would be a second thing to learn for no gain:
//!
//! - `env`, a flat map of strings, spelled as Claude Code's `~/.claude/settings.json` spells it,
//!   down to the variable names. The switch is this program's own name, since it selects a backend
//!   for this program, but the model names are shared because those name someone's Bedrock
//!   deployment.
//! - `model`, for the same reason: it is where both Claude Code and opencode put that choice, and a
//!   key those tools honour that this one silently dropped is worse than one nobody writes.
//! - `permissions`, whose rules Claude Code spells the same way.
//! - `provider`, in opencode's shape, read by [`crate::provider`].
//! - `attribution`, Claude Code's name for what a commit message or a pull request may carry, so
//!   that a checkout asking for none of it says so once in a file rather than in prose an agent
//!   has to be reading at the moment it writes one.
//!
//! They are independent. A file configuring one has nothing to say about the others, and reading any
//! of them does not depend on another being present.
//!
//! # What these files are trusted for
//!
//! Every name in a block is read, not a chosen subset. These are the user's own configuration
//! surface, on the footing [`crate`]'s callers already treat `~/.bravebot` as: a value is something
//! the person running the agent typed, and it is trusted exactly as far as a variable they exported
//! would be. Nothing a turn produces can write one, and no model output reaches one.
//!
//! A project file is a file in a checkout, which is a weaker claim than a file in a home directory:
//! whoever wrote the checkout wrote it. Nothing here distinguishes them, because the resolution this
//! copies does not. What that costs is written down under Known costs in
//! `docs/specs/backends.md` rather than mitigated here.
//!
//! They do not become the process environment. Values are consulted where a variable would be
//! consulted, and handed to a subprocess only where that subprocess is the thing they configure.
//! Installing them globally would put every name in the block in front of every command `run`
//! ever starts, which is a much larger claim than "this is how I reach the backend".
