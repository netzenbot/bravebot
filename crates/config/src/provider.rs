//!
//! The `provider` block in `~/.bravebot/settings.json`, in opencode's shape, so a block copied out
//! of `opencode.json` configures this agent unedited. That constraint decides most of what follows:
//! nothing is required that opencode does not require, no field is added however useful it would be,
//! and a field this crate does not know is read past rather than refused.
//!
//! What this does not hold is a resolved credential. A token is named, by the variables in `env` or
//! by `options.apiKey`, and read when a request needs signing.

/// The endpoints known by the name a provider block gives them.

/// Here because the other tool resolves this from a registry it fetches, and a block copied out of it
/// therefore names an endpoint nowhere. Requiring `baseURL` of such a block is requiring a field that
/// tool does not, which is the one thing the borrowed shape is supposed to rule out.
///
/// Compiled in rather than fetched, and that is not an optimisation. This value is where a bearer
/// credential gets sent, so a service that could edit it could redirect somebody's token by answering
/// a request; see [routing.md](../../../docs/specs/routing.md). A table in the binary is a
