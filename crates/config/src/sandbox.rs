//! Which sandbox mode a session runs its programs under, and who said so (SANDBOX-22).
//!
//! Three places can name one: the command line, the person's own settings file and the managed
//! file. The checkout's two files may only ask for `strict`. A mode is a bundle of what a program
//! `run` starts may reach, so a line in a checkout that could pick `standard` or `off` would let
//! whoever wrote the checkout loosen what the person who cloned it is held to. Asking for `strict`
//! takes nothing from that person, on the footing of the `permissions` keys that only refuse
//! ([`crate::Narrowing`]).
//!
//! The managed file is a floor and not a default: nothing the command line or a settings file says
//! may be looser than it, and a setting that is refuses the session before it starts, naming the
//! file, rather than being read as the pin.
