//! macOS confinement via Seatbelt.
//!
//! Wraps the target command in `sandbox-exec` with a generated deny-by-default
//! profile. The mechanism is what Chrome and Firefox use for their renderer
//! processes; the `sandbox_init` C API is marked deprecated but has no supported
//! replacement for binaries distributed outside the App Store, and `sandbox-exec`
//! remains present on supported macOS versions.
//!
//! Verified empirically: with `(deny default)` a process cannot reach the network
//! (curl fails to resolve or connect) and cannot create files, while still being able
//! to exec and read permitted paths.
