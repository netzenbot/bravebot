//! What a stage reaches of the person's credentials, keyed on the operation its argv names.
//!
//! A push is how most sessions end, so a profile that refuses one is a profile somebody turns off.
//! A stage whose operation needs a credential therefore carries a scope: the remote scope for a
//! `git` operation that talks to a remote and for one of `gh`'s own commands, and one tool's own
//! directory for `aws`, `kubectl` and `docker`. `docs/specs/sandboxing.md` decides the rows, and
//! this is that table in code.
//!
//! A scope follows what the endorsed argv says will run and nothing a configuration file holds.
//! `git` runs whatever its argv or its environment names, `-c core.sshCommand=`, `--upload-pack=`
//! and `GIT_SSH_COMMAND=` among them, so a stage written with one of those, the variable as an
//! assignment in front of it, gets no scope: what would run with the credential is not what the
//! plan says would run.
