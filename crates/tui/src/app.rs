//! Runs turns one at a time. Each turn builds its own policy inside `turn::run`, so

//! again" has anything to refer to.

//! Turns run synchronously: the interface shows "working" and stops accepting input until
//! the reply arrives. That is honest about what is happening, and it keeps two turns from
