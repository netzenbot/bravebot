//! Talking to the main thread from a worker.
//!
//! A turn runs off the main thread so the indicator keeps animating while the model is slow.
//! But only the main thread owns the terminal, so the turn can neither draw an approval prompt
//! nor update a display itself. Both travel over one channel, because the main thread waits on
//! exactly one thing and `mpsc` has no way to select across two.
//!
//! The messages behave in two ways, and the difference is consent:
//!
//! - A write, a run, and a question **ask**. The worker blocks until an answer arrives, and every
//!   failure resolves to the negative one: a channel that cannot carry the question cannot carry
//!   consent either, and a reply that never came is not an answer to report as the user's.
//! - Progress **announces**. There is no reply to wait for and nothing to refuse, so a listener
//!   that has gone away is simply not drawing. Failing a turn because nobody was watching would
//!   let the display outrank the work.
//!
//! Replies come back over one channel too, tagged with what they answer. The worker asks one
//! thing at a time and blocks, so a reply of the wrong kind means the two ends have lost step
//! with each other; that resolves to the negative answer rather than to a retry, because a
//! decision taken against a question nobody matched is worse than no decision at all.
