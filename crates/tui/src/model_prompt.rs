//! Shown by `/model`. The list comes from the endpoints rather than from a set compiled in, so it
//! is whatever the backends actually offer today, and the choice is written to `~/.bravebot`: it
//! outlives the session that made it and applies in every directory.
//!
//! Drawn as a centred panel over the session, the shape every other question here takes. Typing
//! narrows the list, and the rows are grouped under the service that answers them, because a
//! roster is now several rosters at once: Brave's, a Bedrock account's, and whatever a gateway
//! serves, which on its own runs to hundreds of names.
//!
//! Nothing labelled is involved and nothing is quarantined. The names never reach a model: they
//! are drawn for a person, who picks one, and what they picked becomes the `model` field of later
//! requests. That field is routing, and a person choosing it off a list they read is the
//! endorsement for it, the same way a person approving a write destination is.
