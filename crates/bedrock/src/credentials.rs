//! Where the AWS credentials that sign a request come from.
//!
//! The `aws` CLI is asked, rather than the credential files being read here. `~/.aws/config` is an
//! INI file describing SSO sessions, assumed roles, credential processes and chains between them,
//! and the tool that already resolves all of that correctly is installed on any machine configured
//! to reach Bedrock. Reimplementing it would mean an INI parser, the OIDC device-authorization flow,
//! and a cache format that is AWS's to change.
//!
//! # The first-use flow
//!
//! An SSO session expires, and the first request after that fails. The remedy is a browser: `aws sso
//! login` opens one, the person approves the session, and it closes. So a failure to resolve
//! credentials is not final here. The login is run once, and the export retried once, which turns
//! an expired session into a pause rather than an error.
//!
//! # What is trusted, and what is not
//!
//! The subprocess is fixed argv: the program is `aws`, the subcommands are constants in this file,
//! and the only value that varies is the profile name, which comes from the user's own settings and
//! arrives as a separate argument rather than inside a string a shell would split. No model output
//! and no workspace content reaches any of it, and there is no shell.
//!
//! What it is *not* handed is what this agent authenticates to Brave with. `aws` resolves an AWS
//! credential and has no use for a signing key, and `aws sso login` goes on to start a browser,
//! which is an arbitrary networked program. Those two names and no others: the person's own AWS
//! configuration is the whole reason these commands run, and the list they can add names to is about
//! programs of theirs rather than this one. See
//! [`bravebot_config::scrub::apply_own_credentials`].
//!
//! What comes back is a credential, and it is treated as one: [`Secret`] keeps it out of a `Debug`
//! render, and nothing logs it. It is not workspace content, so it carries no label; it never enters
//! a turn, and the only thing it is ever used for is computing a signature.
