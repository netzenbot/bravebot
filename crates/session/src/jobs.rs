//! The roster of background sessions: one directory each under `~/.bravebot/jobs`.
//!
//! What is here is read by `bravebot sessions` for every session on the machine and drawn in a
//! terminal, so [`Job`] is a closed set of fields and every one of them is either something the
//! person typed or a fact about the process (BG-4). There is no field for a reply, a tool result or
//! a question, and nothing in this module takes one: a field that could hold "whatever is useful"
//! would be filled with whatever was nearest.
//!
//! # Whether a process is alive
//!
//! The process holds an exclusive `flock(2)` on the `live` file in its directory for as long as it
//! runs, and the kernel drops the lock when the process ends however it ends. A roster entry is
//! live exactly when something holds that lock, so a process that was killed, crashed, or whose
//! pid was since given to another program is read as it is: not running. A pid and a start time
//! compared against the process table would be a guess about the same thing.
//!
//! The state a process wrote is therefore only believed while it is live (BG-6).
