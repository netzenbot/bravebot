//! The single network egress path.
//!
//! Every outbound request in the process goes through [`Egress::fetch`]. The HTTP
//! client is private to this module and no other crate depends on `ureq`, so there is
//! no second path that could skip the policy gate. That is deliberate: in the design
//! this replaces, two of three fetchers bypassed the redirect check because using the
//! hardened helper was optional.
//!
//! Redirects are followed manually and **revalidated on every hop**. Otherwise a
//! permitted host could redirect to a denied one and the gate would only ever have
//! seen the first URL.
//!
//! Timeouts bound each phase of a request separately rather than the call as a whole, so a
//! reply that takes a long time to write is not confused with a connection that has died. See
//! [`Timeouts`].
//!
//! Responses are size-capped and content-type filtered. That is resource hygiene, not
//! content inspection: the bytes are never parsed to decide anything, they are handed
//! back for the caller to label.
