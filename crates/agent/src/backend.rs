//! Which backend a request goes to.
//!
//! Three exist: the aichat endpoint Brave runs, AWS Bedrock, and an OpenAI-compatible gateway
//! somebody configured. The choice is made from configuration, once, here, so the turn loop and

//! the backend at every call.
//!
//! The choice is not content. It comes from [`bravebot_config::Config`], which is built from the
