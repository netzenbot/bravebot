//! Running a pipeline of argv stages.
//!
//! Process plumbing and nothing else. Every decision about whether a pipeline may run at all is
//! taken before anything here is called: the capability, the person's approval, and the label the
//! output will carry all belong to [`bravebot_core::policy::Policy`]. This module is what happens after
//! those said yes, so it takes a [`Pipeline`] of plain strings and reports what came back.
//!
//! # No shell, at any point
//!
//! Each stage is spawned with its program and its argument vector passed directly to the operating
//! system. Nothing is concatenated into a string and nothing re-parses one, so an argument
//! containing `; rm -rf /` is one argument and arrives as one argument. That is the property the
//! whole tool rests on, and it lives here: a future change that built a command line out of these
//! parts would break it without any gate noticing.
//!
//! Stages are chained the way a shell chains them, by handing one child's stdout to the next
//! child's stdin as a file descriptor. The operating system moves the bytes, so a large
//! intermediate result cannot deadlock against a buffer we forgot to drain.
//!
//! # What runs is what was resolved
//!
//! Each stage is spawned by the resolved path its caller worked out, not by the name in the
//! [`Pipeline`]. The name was resolved once, before the person was asked; spawning by name here
//! would resolve it a second time, leaving a window in which `$PATH` changed and something other
//! than what they approved ran. See [`crate::programs`].
//!
//! # Not confined
//!
//! Deliberately, for now. `bravebot-sandbox` confines processes running code we did not write; these
//! run with whatever access the user's own shell would give them, because `git push` needs `~/.ssh`
//! and the set of programs someone might ask for cannot be enumerated in advance. What holds is the
//! label on the output, not any belief about the binary. Bounding the paths one may reach is decided
//! in `docs/specs/sandboxing.md`, which says what has to exist before a profile applies.
//!
//! # Nothing on stdin unless it was approved
//!
//! The first stage is given an empty stdin rather than the terminal's. A program that reads stdin
//! would otherwise block forever on input nobody is typing, and the turn would hang with no
//! indication of why.
//!
//! Where a caller supplies bytes for it, they are the ones the policy layer resolved out of a
//! quarantined reference and nothing else ([`run_plan`]'s `stdin`). This module writes them to the
//! first step's descriptor on a thread of its own and never looks at them: they are carried into a
//! process exactly as an argument vector is, and no branch here reads a byte of them.
//!
//! # This agent's own credentials are not handed on
//!
//! The environment is inherited, less the names in [`bravebot_config::scrub`]. A person approving a run reads the
//! binary, the argv and the directory, so a credential travelling alongside those is something they
//! were never shown and could not have endorsed. The signing key has no use in a subprocess anyway:
//! a program the planner chose is doing what somebody approved, not authenticating as this agent.
//!
//! The rest of the environment stays. `run aws s3 ls` and `run gh pr list` are things people ask
//! for, and a filter matching names cannot tell one of those from an exfiltration, so it is not
//! attempted: what holds is narrow and exact rather than broad and approximate.
