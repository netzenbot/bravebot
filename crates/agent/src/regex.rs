//! Regular expressions for `search`, matched without backtracking.
//!
//! A pattern arrives through a turn, so the engine that runs it is attack surface. The usual
//! objection to regular expressions here is catastrophic backtracking, where `(a+)+$` against a
//! run of `a`s costs exponential time. That is a property of backtracking implementations, not of
//! regular expressions: this one simulates a Thompson NFA, advancing a set of states one
//! character at a time, so a pattern is matched in time proportional to the length of the line
//! times the size of the pattern and there is no input that makes it blow up.
//!
//! Hand-written rather than a dependency, and deliberately small. Supported, and nothing else:
//!
//! - literal characters
//! - `.`, any character except a newline
//! - `*`, `+`, `?`
//! - `|`, and `(...)` to group, or `(?:...)`, which is the same group since nothing is captured
//! - `(?i)` and `(?-i)`, folding case or not for the rest of the group they are in, and
//!   `(?i:...)` and `(?-i:...)` for only what they enclose
//! - `[abc]`, `[a-z]`, `[^abc]`
//! - `\d`, `\w`, `\s` and their negations `\D`, `\W`, `\S`
//! - `^` and `$`, anchoring to the ends of a line
//! - `\b` and `\B`, word boundaries
//! - a backslash before punctuation, matching it literally
//!
//! Counted repetition (`a{3}`, `a{2,9}`) is absent on purpose, and `{` is an ordinary character.
//! Nesting two of them multiplies the states one expands to, which is the one construct that
//! turns a short pattern into an enormous program, and no bound on the pattern's length would
//! bound the work. Backreferences are absent because they are not regular: no automaton
//! recognises them, and matching one needs the backtracking this engine exists to avoid.
//! Lookaround, named groups and every flag but `i` are absent too, and a `(?` introducing one is
//! refused as that rather than read as a group whose first thing is a `?` with nothing to repeat.
//!
//! Captures are not extracted. `search` reports the line a match was found on, so whether a
//! pattern matched is the whole question, and a boolean is all any of this has to answer.
