//! How much a session asks before it acts.
//!
//! A different axis from [`crate::Mode`], which decides *when* control flow is settled. This decides
//! what happens when a gate has already established that an effect needs a person's consent: whether
//! the question is put to them, answered yes on their behalf, or answered no without asking.
//!
//! Held by the session rather than by a task, because it is a standing answer the person changes
//! while they work: they watch a turn edit files it should not be editing and want the next one to
//! stop and ask, or they have read enough diffs for one afternoon and want the next ten to go
//! through. One key cycles it, and the mode in force is written under the box for as long as it is.
//!
//! # Why plan mode refuses rather than asks
//!
//! [`PermissionMode::Plan`] is not a stricter [`PermissionMode::Ask`]. Its point is that the session
//! is for deciding what to do, so a write is refused outright and the planner is told why: a mode
//! whose only difference was that the person keeps saying no is one where a planner keeps proposing
//! writes and a person keeps declining them, which is the interaction it exists to avoid.
//!
//! Commands are still asked about, and deliberately. Research is most of what planning is, `git log`
//! and a test run are how it is done, and a mode that could not read the tree would write plans from
//! less than the person could see themselves.
