//! Label-aware filesystem tools.
//!
//! Both operations split into a **routing** part and a **content** part, and the split
//! is what the policy gate checks:
//!
//! - `read(path)`: the path is routing. It must be `(T,pub)`, so untrusted content can
//!   never choose which file is read.
//! - `write(path, contents)`: the path is routing, the contents are content. Untrusted
//!   text may be written *into* a file it could not choose.
//!
//! Paths are also confined to a workspace root. That is a second, independent check:
//! the routing label stops content from *supplying* a path, while confinement stops a
//! trusted-but-wrong path from escaping the project.
