//! Running the commands a person attached to a moment.
//!
//! What a hook is and where it is declared belongs to [`bravebot_config::hooks`]. This is what
//! happens when one fires: a process starts, it is given a short line on standard input saying
//! which moment this is, and it is waited for. Nothing it prints is read and nothing it returns is
//! consulted.
//!
//! # A hook decides nothing
//!
//! The exit status is recorded so the person can be told their hook is failing, and it is the only
//! use it is put to. No branch anywhere takes a hook's status, its output, or the fact that it ran
//! at all as a reason to do or not do something else.
//!
//! That is not caution about a person's own program. A hook runs beside a turn that is reading
//! files, so anything it says is a function of bytes nobody vouched for: a hook that grepped a file
//! and exited non-zero would be a file deciding whether the next tool call happens. Refusing an
//! effect is not the safe direction of that, either. A file that could stop exactly the writes it
//! did not want would be choosing what the agent does, which is the one thing this repository is
//! built to prevent.
//!
//! # Not confined
//!
//! Like a program `run` starts, and for the same reason: the person named this command in a file in
//! their own directory, so it gets the access their own shell would give it. `bravebot-sandbox`
//! confines processes running code we did not write, and this is code they wrote.
//!
//! # Nothing from the environment that a run would not get
//!
//! The environment is inherited less the names [`bravebot_config::scrub`] takes off, so this agent's own
//! credentials do not travel into a program the person attached to a moment any more than they
//! travel into one the planner asked for.
