//! The grammar of a command line the planner writes.
//!
//! The planner spells a command the way a person would, and this module is the only thing that
//! ever reads that spelling. It parses the line into a syntax tree, and that tree is what the rest
//! of the compile works from. No shell is started at any point, and no part of the line is ever
//! concatenated back into a string that something else parses.
//!
//! # Why parsing here is not the trap that parsing a shell string is
//!
//! The objection to a shell string is not that it contains dangerous characters. It is that a
//! parser reading one is *predicting* what some other program will do with it, and losing that
//! race means a person approved one thing and another ran. Nothing here predicts anything: no
//! shell will ever see the line, this module is its only reader, and what comes out of it is the
//! whole of what happens.
//!
//! # The grammar is closed
//!
//! [`parse`] accepts exactly the constructs listed on it and refuses everything else, naming the
//! span that caused the refusal. A refusal returns an error and produces no tree, so there is no
//! partial plan for a caller to run: the type is the guarantee. There is no degraded mode and no
//! fallback to a real shell, because a compiler that can be made to give up and hand the string to
//! one is a shell with extra steps.
//!
//! The refusals are not a filter over text that looks dangerous. They are the constructs whose
//! meaning is not in the line. `$(date)` and `$HOME` both stand for something that has to be
//! worked out somewhere else, so a person shown the line has not been shown the plan. Quoting
//! makes every one of them ordinary text, because a quoted `$` is a dollar sign and nothing more.
