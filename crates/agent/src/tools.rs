//! The tool set offered to the model, and dispatch for the calls it makes.
//!
//! Only non-destructive tools are exposed. A model-proposed path may become routing for
//! a confined read (see `Policy::promote_confined_read`), which is what makes iteration
//! possible; nothing here can change the workspace, so a wrong choice costs a step
//! rather than causing harm.
//!
//! Writing is present but gated differently. A write destination chosen by the model is
//! routing derived from whatever it just read, so it is never promoted on its own: the
//! user is shown the change and must approve, and that approval mints a single-use
//! endorsement bound to the exact path. A refusal, or a context where nobody can be asked,
//! means no write.
//!
//! `edit_file` exists because that approval has to be readable. A whole-file body cannot be
//! reviewed on a terminal, so an edit names a passage instead and the user approves a diff.
//! Locating the passage is an ordinary confined read; only the write that follows needs the
//! endorsement. Where the passage is ambiguous the edit is refused rather than guessed,
//! since a guess would mutate bytes that were never shown to anyone.
//!
//! `spawn_processor` is how work happens in a file the planner may not read. It hands
//! quarantined content to a model that holds nothing: no tools, no memory, no second round,
//! and one quarantined output. What comes back is a reference like any other, and
//! `write_file`'s `contents_ref` is what puts it in a file. Between them, the planner can
//! change a file it never saw and the driver can write bytes it never opened.

            "Run a command line. Write it the way you would type it: `grep -rn thing src/ | \
             head -30`. Pipes, &&, ||, ;, ( ), quoting, redirection (>, >>, <, 2>, 2>&1, &>), \
             globs and {a,b} all work in the operands. There is no shell: the line is compiled \
             here into the programs and arguments it names, and anything that cannot be worked \
             out from the line itself is refused rather than guessed at. $(...), backticks, $VAR \
             and ${...} are refused for that reason: write the value out. Name the program \
             outright for the same reason, since a pattern there stands for whichever file it \
             matches today: `./scr*.sh` is refused where `./script.sh` runs. Quoting settles all \
             of them, so '$HOME' is six characters and reaches the program as one argument. A \
             pattern the program should match itself is quoted for the same reason, so write \
             `find . -name '*.md'`: unquoted, `*.md` is replaced by the files it matches here, \
             and passed as written only when none matches. A pattern after the = of an option, as in `grep -r x . --include=*.md`, \
             is passed to the program as written. The user \
             approves the compiled plan before anything runs, so say what you are running and \
             why first. \
             \
             Narrowing the result inside the line is the cheapest thing you can do, and usually \
             the difference between a few lines and a few thousand tokens: pipe to `head -n`, \
             ask grep for `-l` to get names only or `-c` for a count, take a line range with \
             `sed -n 40,80p` rather than reading a whole file. Use whichever tool returns less, \
             and a command that filters usually returns less. \
             \
             Output comes back as text you can read where the user has vouched for every \
             command in the line; otherwise it comes back as a reference, like a file you may \
             not read: pass it to read_output to ask the user to show it to you, hand it to \
             spawn_processor, or write it to a file with write_file. Do use it to compile and \
             test what you changed. \
             \
             A program meant to keep running, such as a server or a watcher, needs \
             background: true. Without it the line is waited on and stopped at its deadline \
             ("
            .to_string()
                + &format!(
                    "{deadline_default} seconds by default; set deadline_seconds to allow up to \
                     {deadline_ceiling}"
                )
                + "), so there is \
             no moment at which it is up and you can do anything with it. \
             \
             Asked to watch something, or to say when it changes, decide first what is being \
             watched, because a file and a program are watched by different means. A file takes no \
             command at all: read_file hands back a change token, and comparing the token from one \
             look with the token from the next is the whole of the technique. A program's own \
             output is watched here: start it with background: true and call job_output with \
             wait_seconds, which is one call covering a window rather than a look per turn. \
             Neither reaches past this turn by itself: a background job is killed when the turn \
             ends unless the account of its start says the session keeps it, and comparing a token \
             needs a later look. "

/// - `todo_write`, because the list on the screen belongs to the turn the person is watching, and
///   a delegate writing to it would replace what they were reading with the steps of a sub-task
///   they did not ask about.
/// - `schedule_next`, because what it schedules is another turn of the session, sending the line
///   the person typed. A delegate was given a task by a planner and ends when it answers, so a
///   wait it asked for would either be dropped or would put the session back to work on something
///   nobody at the keyboard is waiting for.
/// - `vet_content`, because what crosses back from a delegate is its own set of rules and a
///   delegate has nobody watching it. The prompt it would draw belongs to the person who set the
///   sub-task going, about content they never asked to see, in the middle of work they are not
///   reading.
/// - `fetch_url`, because every kind holds the capability for reaching the network so the driver
///   can make its model call, and that is the whole of what it buys. A delegate pointing a
///   request at a host of its own would be egress nobody approved for this sub-task, and the

///   held is what makes this one a name and not a capability check: no gate would refuse it.
