//! The profile a program a person asked for runs under.
//!
//! `run` starts the programs a plan names. On Linux and macOS each step reads the machine except the
//! locations that hold a credential, writes the directories the session was opened on, its scratch
//! directory, the temporary directory and the toolchain caches, and reads a credential directory
//! only where the scope its argv names says so. On Windows a step is held to the platform's base,
//! the list its resolved binary brings, the scope its argv names, the places its binary is
//! installed and the session's directories, and to nothing else a person's account can reach.
//! `docs/specs/sandboxing.md` decides every row; this composes them for one step.
//!
//! Nothing a program printed, and no value the model supplied, reaches a row. The inputs are the
//! compiled [`Step`], which a person read, and the session's own directories.
