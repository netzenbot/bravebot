//! A language server across the turns of one session, driven by a real subprocess.
//!
//! LSP-5 and LSP-8 both say the same thing about a server's lifetime: one approval starts one
//! process, it is kept for the session, and it is shut down when the session ends. Neither is
//! decidable from the bookkeeping alone, because the whole question is who owns the set of
//! servers. A test that builds one `Servers` and asks it twice proves only that a map is a map.
//!
//! So these drive two turns of one conversation against a fake server that records each time it
//! starts, and count the approvals a person is put through.
//!
//! # Why a binary of its own
//!
//! The fake server is found the way a real one is, on `$PATH`, which belongs to the process. The
//! tests below therefore set it, and a variable set on one thread is set for every test sharing
//! the binary. An integration test is its own process, so nothing outside this file is affected.
//!
//! Unix only: the server is a shell script, and what the launch path needs from it is an
//! executable file with a shebang.
