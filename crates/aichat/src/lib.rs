//! Client for an OpenAI-compatible backend.
//!
//! Targets `POST /v1/chat/completions`. Despite the `/v1` prefix that is the **v2**
//! API for Brave's own endpoint: the server infers the version from the path, so there is no
//! `/v2/` route to construct. `/v1/conversation` is the older, deprecated surface.
//!
//! Three ways of being authenticated are reached through this one client, because they speak the
//! same protocol. Brave's endpoint signs its requests; see [`bravebot_signing`]. A configured
//! gateway bearer-authenticates and may carry pass-through options in the body. Brave's endpoint
//! again, where [`bravebot_config::env_var::API_KEY`] holds a key, presents that key instead of a
//! signature and is answered by a handler that relays the whole parameter list to the model, so the
//! level in [`protocol::ChatRequest::effort`] reaches the model rather than being dropped. Same host,
//! same path, same body: the header is the whole of what decides which handler answers.
//!
//! What differs between them is a URL, a header and a body field, which is why
//! [`AichatClient::prepare`] is the only place that branches on it: the framing, the retries and the
//! cancellation are the same code for all three.
//!
//! All traffic goes through [`bravebot_net::Egress`] so the policy gate sees it, and the model
//! reported in the response is preserved because the server may substitute a different
//! one than was requested.
