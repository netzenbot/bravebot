//! A session in lines, with the terminal left as it was found.
//!
//! The interface that draws takes the terminal for its length: raw mode, a screen of its own,
//! mouse reporting, bracketed paste (INPUT-33). What that buys is a transcript repainted in place,
//! and what it costs is everything that reads a terminal the ordinary way. A viewport rewritten in
//! place is not a document a screen reader can follow, and what leaves the top of it is in this
//! program's own scroller rather than in the scrollback a person's own tooling knows how to read.
//! Without a session that takes none of it, the alternative to that viewport is not using the
//! program.
//!
//! So this is the same session with nothing drawn. A prompt is a line read from stdin, the reply
//! is written to stdout when the turn ends, and progress and every question go to stderr, which
//! is the one-shot run's own division of the two streams (CLI-5) with a person in front of it.
//! Nothing is repainted, nothing is animated, and no mode is ever asked of the terminal.
//!
//! It is an option on this program rather than a second one because the machinery is the
//! machinery already here: the turn loop, the confirmer, the reporter and the trust question are
//! the ones the other two surfaces use, and the whole of what is new is where a question is
//! written and where its answer is read from. What it does not have is everything that was a
//! drawing: the scroller, the key list, the slash commands, `@` naming a file, a picture on the
//! clipboard. CLI-14 is what says so.
