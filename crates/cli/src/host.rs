//! The process behind a background session, and the socket a terminal reaches it by (BG-1, BG-7,
//! BG-9, BG-10).
//!
//! The session in it is the session in lines ([`crate::plain`]) with its streams swapped: its
//! prompts and its answers are read from a queue, and what it would write to a terminal is kept
//! and handed to whoever is attached. Nothing else about it differs, so the prompts it puts are the
//! prompts a foreground session puts.
//!
//! What this module decides is when a line may be taken. A line is taken only while the session is
//! blocked waiting for one, and then once: a line typed while a turn is running is refused rather
//! than kept, because kept it would answer whichever question came next without the person having
//! seen it. A reply is taken only while the session waits for a prompt, so it can never answer a
//! question.

// The socket half of this is unix only, and the rest of it is only reached through that half.
