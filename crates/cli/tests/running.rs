//! What running the built binary does: the status a failure exits with, the one command an
//! incognito session refuses, and what `doctor` says about the settings file a process found.
//!
//! [CLI-6] and [INCOG-7] are the clauses, and both are properties of a process rather than of a
//! function. `main` returns an `ExitCode` that nothing in the same process can read back, and
//! asking for a session that leaves nothing behind is a one-way door for the life of a process,
//! so a test that engaged it would make every other test in its binary incognito too. Running the
//! binary answers both. [PERM-11] is here for a different reason: the report it requires is made
//! out of two crates and printed by a third, and a process is what puts the three together.
