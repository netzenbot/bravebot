//! The library's surface: what a front-end can ask for, and what it gets told.
//!
//! One method per protocol request, plus a callback events leave through. Nothing here
//! writes to stdout, reads stdin, or ends the process; a transport does that, and there
//! can be more than one.
//!
//! # Handles
//!
//! A session's id is unique only within its project directory, so calls do not carry
//! `(directory, id)` pairs. Opening one mints a short handle that stands for the pair for
//! as long as this process lives. Handles are not written down and a front-end must not
//! store one: `session.list` returns the durable `(directory, id)`, and opening converts
//! that into a handle again.
