//! Running a turn, and telling a front-end what it is doing.

//!
//! [`BridgeReporter`] and [`BridgeSink`] **announce**. There is no reply to wait for and
//! nothing to refuse, so every failure is a dropped line.
//!
//! [`BridgeConfirmer`] **asks**, and blocks until it is answered. Every failure resolves
