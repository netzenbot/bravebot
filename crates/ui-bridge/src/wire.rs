//! Turning the agent's types into JSON, and reading answers back.
//!
//! One function per row of the protocol's type table, so the projection lives in one
//! place and a change to it is a change to one function. Pure: nothing here does I/O,
//! which is what makes the whole table testable in a few milliseconds.
//!
//! Two rules run through all of it.
//!
//! **Send the discriminant, not the prose.** [`Landing::describe`] and
//! [`Reach::describe`] return sentences meant for a screen. They are wording, they will
//! change, and a client that matches on them is matching on prose — which is how a
//! message that merely mentions a refusal becomes one. The tag is the contract; a
//! front-end may render its own words from it.
//!
//! **Unknown input degrades toward less trust.** Reading a tag we do not recognise gives
//! the more restrictive variant, never the more permissive one, mirroring what
//! `Snapshot` and `Record::trust_map` already do upstream. There is no error case for a
//! decision, because refusing to parse an answer and refusing the write it answers are
//! the same outcome and only one of them is honest about it. [`composed`], [`permission_mode`] and
//! [`sandbox_mode`] are the functions here that refuse, and each reads a claim a request
//! makes rather than an answer to a question: there is no quieter reading of a client asking
//! for a tag it may not have, and a turn that went out untagged instead would be drawn as a
//! prompt nobody typed.
